      "But Jeff, do you want to talk about the UK?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, I think probably to mention, number one, is we are more focused on certain aspects of the portfolio, UK products being one of those, because it's our core business.,1,1\n",
      "Cost improvements there have helped us, I think, in the competitive situations where we priced more aggressively.,2,3\n",
      "We have also changed the sales plan this year.,1,1\n",
      "We have implemented new sales plans to emphasize TOV less and revenue growth year-over-year and new acquisition of business in the UK more.,1,1\n",
      "So you might see a mix in our TOV there, but we're - for all intent and purposes we're going after revenue growth and gaining back share that we have lost.,1,1\n",
      "I think also some of the infrastructure improvements that we're making in the UK, we are also bringing that through our product portfolio and that's helping as well.,2,1\n",

      "I will ask Gavin if he wants to say anything about UK broadband market.,1,1\n",

      "We haven't seen any impact on our ability to acquire customers, be it from TalkTalk or anybody else in the market.,1,1\n",

      "At the trade press, [indiscernible] suggested you are upgrading your network to cope with broadcast IGTV .,1,1\n",
      "Is that right and would you be able to get rid of additional terrestrial multiplex at some point?,1,2\n",
      "And then secondly please, what is the latest on the duct and pole trials and the prospects for any agreed reference offer any time soon?,3,1\n",
      "Many thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: In terms of - multicast is absolutely on our roadmap, as we said.,1,1\n",
      "I don't think that's instead of DTT, I think that's as well as.,1,1\n",
      "I think broadcast - the main broadcast channels probably will be better on broadcast, but there certainly be other channels, linear channels which we provided over wires effectively.,2,1\n",
      "And it gives us real optionality, in fact the optionality to combine different types of offers.,1,1\n",
      "What we are seeing generally among customers is things that they don't have to watch live; more and more they're not, they're watching it on demand when they want to.,1,1\n",
      "But clearly things like sport and sort of events like X Factor they will - they'll want to watch live.,2,1\n",
      "So I think the UK is in a very interesting position; it seemed - I've talked to a lot of technology companies around the world, they see the UK in this way, which is that combination of DTT as fiber coming together and it's one of the reasons they're very interested in YouView.,3,1\n",
      "On duct and pole, and I'll ask Liv to comment in a second on it.,1,1\n",
      "I mean we are working hard to - on the duct and pole trails.,1,1\n",
      "I think it's a - I think question is can we come to an agreed reference or we will base our pricing off our cost base and we've already said our pricing is better than European average.,2,1\n",
      "I can't speak, necessarily, for whether that fits into other people's business plans.,1,1\n",
      "But what certainly our reference offer cannot do is solve other people's business plans that are - uneconomic.,1,1\n",
      "But Liv, do you want to say how it's going?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, so what we said we'd do is that we would look for people to trial with us; we've got three parties signed up to trial and we'll next year seek the terms from more [indiscernible] than recently, but we've got those terms and we are waiting for them to begin the actual dig.,1,1\n",
      "So they're surveying.,1,1\n",
      "As we've said all along, the state of ducts in the UK is not exactly perfect.,3,1\n",
      "And some of the early surveys shows blocked up, so people are now surveying new routes.,1,2\n",
      "So that's happening at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "We would hope that they would begin to do the actual physical dig activity maybe even as early as over the next couple of weeks and as soon as we've got early results, we will issue revised prices, as we've always said.,2,1\n",
      "So I would say certainly not before September, but I would imagine early September is when we hope to have the results from those trials and we would then issue some revised prices.,3,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Many thanks.,2,1\n",

      "S&P recently raised you to BBB.,1,1\n",
      "I was just wondering how should we think about how that impacts your thoughts on distribution going forward and how should we think about any particular timing on any communication you - that you make on distribution following that announcement?,1,1\n",
      "And secondly - very hypothetical question.,1,1\n",
      "But if the triennial review on the pension scheme at the end of the year decides that your scheme is in surplus, could you just confirm that the topper payments would stop immediately from that point?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: The danger with hypothetical questions is you might give real answers.,1,2\n",
      "Look, I think it's too early to speculate as to what might happen on the triennial.,1,1\n",
      "We have got to see what happens there.,1,1\n",
      "In principal, we won't pay additional contributions into a surplus scheme.,1,1\n",
      "Under that [indiscernible] valuation, I would find it difficult to understand why one would.,1,2\n",
      "But I think as you said, we're talking hypothetical questions at the moment.,1,1\n",

      "We did take share from fiber.,1,1\n",

      "In terms of fiber and cable overlap and - Liv, anything you want to say about that?,1,1\n",
      "A: I mean we went to three different areas, if you remember, in our early fiber deployment.,1,1\n",
      "We decided to try some rural as well as just urban.,1,1\n",
      "We also went to some of the big urban city areas and then we also said we'd try market towns.,1,1\n",
      "And I think - so what you can expect in our early phases is where we are typically in the urban areas there's very strong crossover in terms of dense populations.,1,1\n",
      "Clearly when we are trying out places like market towns and more rural locations, then it's just us.,2,1\n",
      "So it's a bit of mix from the early days.,1,1\n",
      "As time goes on, as we build up towards the 66%, then we have taken learnings from that and, my guess, we announced as you know, kind of, about a year and a half in advance.,2,1\n",

      "One of the things I want to be really clear about, because I know some people seem to have misunderstood this, that PlusNet represents well under a fifth of our net adds.,1,2\n",
      "So whilst PlusNet is a very good, very price-led, cheaper standalone product, actually we are seeing the vast majority of the increase in our base coming from BT Total Broadband and the numbers speak for themselves on fiber.,4,2\n",
      "And we are pricing fiber very aggressively, quite intentionally, because we want to get people on fiber.,1,4\n",
      "We make a - better ARPU from fiber, because people are choosing the higher level.,2,1\n",
      "So what you are seeing is sort of pricing fiber is very comparable with a top range in - DSL.,1,1\n",
      "But actually because of the mix, we are seeing an increase in ARPU.,1,1\n",
      "And of course, people are choosing bundles and you can see - what's our summer sale offer just now, Gavin?,1,1\n",

      "Could you just give us a bit of color into how you achieved that?,1,1\n",

      "There is an element of which the indirect and direct sort of numbers bounce around a little bit, depending on whether we've got temporary people in to go and help with work stack and things like that.,2,1\n",

      "It will, as Ian said, bounce around, because in some instances we are insourcing work from our indirect labor.,1,1\n",

      "It was - Q1 is very consistent with what we expected.,1,1\n",
      "So it's not - from our point of view, Q1 numbers are no great surprise in terms of revenue.,3,1\n",

      "I think as we talked about it last year, we didn't think that the - necessarily that the execution was probably outstanding in there.,3,1\n",
      "But the - but we did have to establish ourselves as [indiscernible] , which we did.,1,1\n",
      "Critically what was important was a overall vision and in fact, actually, overall broadband and I can put a really big tick in the box for broadband.,1,2\n",

      "In terms of Vision, a very solid 24% growth and that compares very nicely with other TV companies.,4,1\n",

      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, well that trend change is sort of - is made up of two factors going different directions.,1,1\n",
      "The big factor that caused the trend change is that Orange have moved on to Wholesale for their - to run their broadband service.,1,1\n",
      "So - and I think they're seeing significant improvements in service as a result of that.,2,1\n",
      "So that's - that's the change that's going on at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "Against that actually we've seen continued quite strong movement to LLU by other providers and so it's sort of - ex-Orange you would see something different.,1,1\n",
      "And of course, the other factor I should mention in terms of overall numbers is the success of BT Retail.,3,1\n",
      "So actually what you've seen is the key non-LLU companies that were - add business, doing particularly well.,1,1\n",

      "And secondly, a bit cheeky one.,1,1\n",
      "On the Global Services, you talked about new business sign-ups being accelerating the revenue trend.,1,1\n",
      "Can you talk about the margin profile of new business relative to retention business?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: In terms of Global Services, that second question.,1,1\n",
      "I think new business - all new - all business we've got goes through clear return processes and I think this might be one of the strengths of our processes now that new business we're taking on is - we're very clear about.,1,1\n",
      "So I think there is not particularly any commentary I can give on that.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of at Infinity, how many are new to high speed broadband?,1,1\n",
      "Well, I think most of them would be new to high speed broadband on the basis that unless they were one of the very few customers that are actually on Virgin's high speed network, they'll be new to it.,1,1\n",
      "But there aren't too many of those on Virgin's network, so I'm going to guess that almost all of them are going to be new to high speed broadband and they really like it and they're seeing - they are seeing very high speeds particularly.,3,1\n",
      "One of the things we're noticing that they are particularly liking is upstream speeds; the fact that they're getting upstream speeds 10 Megs-plus is actually a bigger multiple than a lot of the downstream speeds.,3,1\n",
      "And the world we're in today is becoming a lot more symmetrical.,1,1\n",
      "But in terms of being new to - if what your question was, are they new to us overall, we said about a third of the customers now coming on to Infinity are due to BT Retail.,1,1\n",

      "Could you just clarify what you mean by growth there?,1,1\n",
      "I presume you mean gross adds, but I'm not sure if I've got that right?,1,2\n",
      "A: Net adds, so if you said in - that we grew let's just say on average by 5% of our customer base in Market 3 in a particular quarter it would be 7.5% in the areas with fiber.,1,1\n",
      "So that's what I meant.,1,1\n",

      "I just wondered if you could describe in broad terms without obviously giving away any commercial secrets, quite what your marketing process is.,1,1\n",

      "What's the marketing process there?,1,1\n",
      "And would you say that your Retail marketing folk have learned how to sell fiber against cable over the last sort of few months of practice and how would you describe that?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, we've actually been running - if you actually look at our net adds on the base of fiber that existed.,1,1\n",
      "Last quarter I commented actually pro rata we were selling six times as many fiber connections pro rata as cable were.,1,1\n",

      "It's a bit like - it's become the generic name for a lot of fiber and that's important.,2,1\n",
      "And that was a very conscious decision.,1,1\n",
      "You can get fiber from anyone.,1,1\n",
      "You can only get Infinity from BT and I think that's encouraging.,2,1\n",
      "And then what we - overlay that with a mixture of direct mail, local marketing to reflect and also things like people pre-registering and showing their interest and just general advertising.,2,1\n",
      "But I think it's very much a multi-layered approach and word of mouth is also [indiscernible] .,1,1\n",

      "We are still early days, so be clear.,1,1\n",

      "Firstly in Wholesale, I wonder if there is any chance you could give us an indication of how big those migration costs currently are of the sort of total cost base.,1,1\n",
      "I guess in the quarter of about 700 million of cost base.,1,1\n",
      "So I wonder what that might - what those migration costs might be in terms of percentages, just thinking about how that flows through for the rest of the year?,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, just in terms of your confidence on the top line, I am just thinking about how that sits against sort of concerns of a weaker consumer and weaker economic environment.,2,2\n",
      "Do you feel pretty insulated against that weaker environment to give you the confidence on the revenues?,3,2\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: On Wholesale migration costs, one of the things got to bear in mind, I mean, we are talking about differentials of a few percent here against expectations.,1,1\n",
      "So the answer is there's some million single digit millions higher than we expected per quarter and it will carry on for a few quarters.,1,1\n",
      "We are not talking - and it's low single digits at that.,1,2\n",
      "And it's one of the things when you are talking about year-on-year movements and whether you are talking about - I think consensus was something like minus 7% on profits and we came in at minus 9%, it's a - it's fairly small parts of that and of course it is only one part of it.,2,1\n",
      "So answer is low single digit, but will carry on for quite a few quarters.,1,2\n",
      "In terms of top line, I think it very dangerous for any CEO to say the economy has no effect on our business.,1,3\n",
      "And some of the countries we operate in we see - it obviously creates more headwinds.,1,1\n",
      "But what is important for BT overall and remains, absence of meltdown, is what we do ourselves.,1,2\n",
      "And if you took something - took areas of our business, particularly we've got low market share, enhancing our market share and creating new products and services is more important than just the market growth.,1,2\n"

      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yes, good morning, very quick question.,3,1\n",
      "I was currently looking at your net debt to EBITDA level, which is standing at [indiscernible] 1.6 down, something around for the last three quarters in a row.,1,1\n",
      "I'd like to ask your views on where you would expect, are you comfortable with that level or is it something that you think you should further improve?,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I think that when you look at our net debt EBITDA, more importantly as the rating agencies look at it, you've got to remember we've got some operating leases and also pension that has to be added on.,1,1\n",
      "To be honest, we're not particularly targeting a net debt to EBITDA level.,1,1\n",
      "It's very much more - we want to be triple B, triple B-plus and we know full well with the rating agencies, different environments sets at different levels.,1,1\n",
      "We will see our debt, our debt reducing overall - I mean, if you look at the cash we are generating and you look at even what goes into pension scheme, pays out in dividends, there is a decent difference.,1,1\n",
      "So I think we will have a lower level of debt.,1,1\n",
      "But actually we've got lots of room.,1,1\n",
      "We keep on saying this to - given the confidence in the future cash flow to pay increasing dividends, to continue this sort of strong investment profile we've got, contribute to the pension scheme and pay down debt.,2,1\n",
      "So it's not an either or in any of this things.,1,1\n",
      "But - I think we're pretty conservative management and you will see a gradual - if you look at long-term trend, I think it will be a gradual decrease in that ratio would be - Tony.,3,2\n",
      "Q: Sorry, just to follow-up on that.,1,1\n",
      "Does that mean that the main viable that may affect that level is actually the situation on the pension scheme?,1,1\n",
      "A: It is one of the inputs.,1,1\n",
      "I was just making the point you can't just look at pure debt to EBITDA on its own.,1,1\n",
      "You have to look at some other factors.,1,1\n",
      "Tony, do you want to add something?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, just - look, the rating agencies, as Ian said, add to the debt number the operating leases as well as the pension deficit.,1,2\n",
      "The range they want to try and operate on, and they calculate it differently, is right about between 2 and 2.5 to 1 to try and get a rating between BBB and BBB+.,1,1\n",
      "We will operate within that range, which means we are still further things that we need to do in terms of improving our ratio and that will be basically in terms of improving the EBITDA as well as reducing the debt.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, as Tony said, that one of the best ways to improve the ratio is to improve EBITDA and that's what we also said we would do.,2,1\n",

      "Two questions please.,3,1\n",
      "First one on Retail revenues.,1,1\n",
      "I think consensus has got an improving revenue trend on Retail, like minus 3% penciled in for full year this year, at minus 1% for next year.,2,1\n",
      "Given that you've been tracking in the range minus 4% to minus 4.5% for the last sort of couple of quarters, I wonder whether you're still anticipating sort of an improvement in that trend and what quarter do you think we could start to see that kick in?,2,2\n",
      "And then the second question is just on Infinity.,1,1\n",
      "I'm wondering about the sort of 70,000 adds you posted in the last quarter.,1,1\n",
      "Do you feel you're fulfilling all the demand that's out there, or is there a constraint on your ability to sort of connect consumers in volume?,1,2\n",
      "And if there is, I just wondered whether you could sort of explain what that might be and when that constraint might loosen up?,1,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: There is not over time a big constraint on Infinity and so I don't think that's the major factor.,1,2\n",
      "I'd love - I look forward to there being constraint, because that means we are doing a lot more.,3,2\n",
      "But certainly we are - if we have a sudden surge in demand that could be an issue.,1,1\n",
      "But I think over a long - over any sort of three month, four month period, you can react to pretty much any demand level.,3,1\n",
      "So at the moment, no, I think we are in pretty good shape in terms of being able to meet.,4,1\n",
      "If there was much higher demand for fiber generally across the network, then Openreach would have to react.,1,1\n",
      "But we are not going to carry lots of spare engineers when we don't need it.,1,1\n",
      "But I think what we have noticed it's amazing what we can do.,3,1\n",
      "In terms of quarterly trends, individual level for LOB's against consensus, I think as I've been told by my investor relations man on my right, it would be inappropriate for the CEO to give further guidance over and above what we have done.,1,1\n",
      "We said the trends going to improve and that remains the thing.,2,1\n",

      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: YouView launch timing, I think we'll be looking at spring.,1,1\n",
      "So, I'm glad to say it's under a year; not the standard answer of around a year.,2,1\n",
      "So we are making progress and I think [indiscernible] chairman has certainly helped drive that forward.,3,1\n",
      "On BT UK, a little bit of that is - we'll see, but I'm sure Liv can give a little bit more detail, because there has been some real progress in BT UK in funds being allocated.,3,1\n",
      "But, do you want to talk about some of the dates and, I mean, a little bit - you may have to ask BT UK who the competitors are, we could probably only speculate, I would guess.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, so I think there's two that are advancing quote from BT UK and one that's kind of slightly outside the process, but is becoming badged as BT UK and that's Wales.,2,1\n",
      "So then the two that are advancing at speed anyway is the North Yorkshire bid and the Cumbria bid and both of those are - there in dialogues, there beginning to have financial conversations with the various bidders.,1,1\n",
      "And as I understand it, there are probably 4 to 5 bidders being selected moving to the PQQ stage for each of those.,1,1\n",
      "Wales is probably the one that was outside of BT UK, but has now had, as you know, the 50-ish million handed over, or allocated, over the course of the last couple weeks.,1,1\n",
      "So I think it's becoming badged as probably the fifth of the early pilots.,1,1\n",
      "And the decision making there is expected before Christmas, so it's kind of like a lead up to Christmas decision-making situation.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I mean I would say generally with regional bids, I mean one of the things you see is a big difference in our performance for instance in Northern Ireland and Cornwall in terms of the speed of the actual delivery compared with a number of other areas in the UK where money was put in and other people stepped forward claiming to do the thing.,1,1\n",
      "And frankly, their system is not benefiting.,1,1\n",
      "They are not getting service and I think people are seeing that.,1,1\n",
      "That being said and I just say it right now; I don't think we'll win every BT UK bid.,1,1\n",
      "I just think that is the way of things.,1,1\n",
      "But we think our ability to deliver is clearly very superior and we've been doing this for a while.,4,1\n",

      "Please go ahead Stuart.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, couple of questions.,1,1\n",
      "First of all, you spoke about improvements to your network that could double the Infinity speeds and there was a few processes that you had to go through.,2,1\n",
      "Could you give us an update on how they are going?,1,1\n",
      "And secondly, just kind of a follow-up to an earlier question.,1,1\n",
      "Clearly chasing revenues in Global Services; you do say the processes are in place to ensure that they meet to return hurdles.,1,1\n",
      "But the same could be said about Global Services when you were growing revenues aggressively in the past.,1,3\n",
      "Could you just give us some guides on what process changes you have made to ensure the same pitfalls don't befall those revenues this time?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I'll ask Jeff maybe to comment on the clearly - we are not clearly chasing revenue.,1,1\n",
      "We are clearly chasing profitable growth; that's for sure.,2,1\n",
      "And maybe I'd ask you to look at our profit and cash flow performance of the group to give you a general feel for maybe a change in BT in how it delivers.,2,1\n",
      "But Jeff, do you want to talk about some of the processes we go through to deliver profitable growth?,2,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "The process we use is a - it's a blend of EBITDA performance and cash flow performance, what areas of the business we are selling into, whether it's geographic, the overall risk profiles.,1,2\n",
      "And we look at deal quality in those parameters.,1,1\n",
      "Over the past two years, we have implemented common solution centers.,1,1\n",
      "We have three of those around the world and what you get out of those in the more complex deals, and they all go through that, are more consistent solutions that we can rely on and that have less risk profile to them.,1,2\n",
      "And then an account start-up unit that gets us more consistent, coupled with a - what we call an IR team - IRT team that looks at deals once we implement them.,1,1\n",
      "And it's an independent review team.,1,1\n",
      "So all that comes together in what we call our overall risk management approach when we implement deals.,1,2\n",
      "And I'd have to say I can - sitting here, there's probably three that I can remember of the top of my head where we chose not to pursue because those things didn't come together.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay, thanks Jeff.,2,1\n",
      "On the [indiscernible] chain, first of all we have to agree this with industry and we are making good progress on that, but it's still being discussed in industry.,4,1\n",
      "Then we have to test it, roll it out and be able, as they say in our terms, consume it.,1,1\n",
      "All of that we have a good degree of confidence and unless there's a major problem we haven't expected to have it done by the end of 2012.,3,2\n",
      "So I think it will be - you'll see next year we will be looking at not just downstream speeds going up to 80 Megs, but I think also very important, upstream speeds going 20 Megs and maybe even slightly higher than that.,1,1\n",
      "And that will be a multiple, for instance, of the cable network on upstream speeds.,1,1\n",
      "So - and we are seeing, as I said, earlier customers find that very important.,1,1\n",
      "So I think we've got two more questions, so we will take two - take three more questions?,1,1\n",
      "Two more questions; we'll take those two more questions and then we will be done.,1,1\n",

      "Next question is from the line of Maurice Patrick from Barclays.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Hi guys.,1,1\n",
      "We've focused a lot on cost reductions whereas in Openreach this quarter your cost went up by 4%.,1,1\n",
      "Just curious to understand whether that's all fiber related, the element to which the cost increases is external rather than internal costs and also where we are on the cost time-to-install on the Infinity base?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I mean I'll look to comment on why our costs went up.,1,1\n",
      "And the - is actually, it's more volume; particularly engineering volume is being a key thing.,1,1\n",
      "Also some elements of clearing; we did - we have been bringing down our work stack and that's been important.,1,1\n",
      "And yes, we have - we are doing a lot of Infinity.,1,1\n",
      "But Liv, do you want to?,1,1\n",
      "A: I mean the other dynamic is the extra leavers, so we did fast track some leaver payments during the course of the quarter.,2,1\n",
      "And [indiscernible] it as well, and that definitely will help us going forward.,1,1\n",
      "But I mean the volume is a major increase for us; that's a good news situation.,3,1\n",
      "So if you're going to grow copper, you are going to spend more volume and it's a combination of those couple.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Great.,3,1\n",
      "And Adam, I think you've got the honor of the last question.,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Next question is from the line of Adam Rumley from HSBC.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Thanks very much.,1,1\n",
      "I just wondered if you could comment on the progress you are making with fiber to the home.,3,1\n",
      "I guess you are now about a third of the way through the complete roll out for fiber and I just wondered the kind of time scales you're thinking about at the moment ?,2,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: The answer is we are making progress, ask Liv.,3,1\n",
      "It's tough going; I've got to be clear of that.,1,2\n",
      "But we are making progress in more areas being rolled out.,3,1\n",
      "And clearly as we go on, fiber to the home will represent a bigger proportion of the mix than it does currently.,1,1\n",
      "But Liv, do you want to talk about the roll out areas and how many areas we're rolling out to and - etcetera?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, so what we decided to do when we're doing fiber to the home is we could have gone for just one type of area and we could have probably got some high numbers on the board quite early on.,1,1\n",
      "But what we've realized is that our view is that if you are going to do 66% of the UK and beyond, ideally - if we're into BT UK bids as well, then clearly you need to have a formula that you can do at scale across the UK in every different type.,1,1\n",
      "So we chose to go for different pilot areas; so York, [indiscernible] , Cornwall, [indiscernible] , there all very different places and that gave us a chance to see what FTTP looks like in different parts of the UK.,2,1\n",
      "It looks different, but it looks tricky I guess in lots of those until you begin to work out the perfect process.,3,2\n",
      "And I think we're still working out that perfect process.,3,1\n",
      "We have made tremendous progress over the course of the last six months I would say, with working it out.,4,1\n",
      "At the same time it's making sure that we are clear on the fact our customers want speed fiber now, which is why we have been making sure that we can give FTTC as quick as possible across the UK.,1,1\n",
      "A couple of recent innovations we've made is - I know these might sound not very exciting to the rest of you, but they are very exciting to me - is that we've got a new spade and this new spade allows us to dig just literally next door to a pole and it means if you are doing a pole version of FTTP, you are actually able to do it much quicker, because you don't need to do a separate civil dig.,4,2\n",
      "It can be done there and then by the same man.,1,1\n",
      "This special spade can cut through concrete and is a genuine innovation in the marketplace.,2,1\n",
      "So that's one I was highlighted - that was the highlight of my quarter.,1,1\n",
      "And the secondary, I think we have worked out is you can also do at the same areas, you can do a very good mixture of FTTC and FTTP.,4,1\n",
      "And originally we were like; you're either one or the other.,2,1\n",
      "We have worked out a much clearer, a much more efficient financially and effective process both operationally to be able to do quicker fiber in areas by doing a mix on a street by street basis.,1,1\n",
      "And we're doing that in Cornwall right now in conjunction with the deal we've got down there.,1,1\n",
      "So there are a couple of innovations for you.,1,1\n",
      "A: Well that just goes to show how quickly someone can move from being our strategy director to her special spade.,2,1\n",
      "And I think I would also say it's got to be remembered, of course, with FTTC and bringing fiber in effect within about 400 yards of the home.,1,1\n"

      "In terms of that competitive intensity, I would see if Jeff wants to add anything, but it remains a competitive market.,1,1\n",
      "We've had some good wins, which we are pleased with.,3,1\n",
      "I think the same in SME business where we've done well in what's been a difficult marketplace, but maybe Jeff, you want to talk about the corporate side and government side on SMEs?,1,2\n",
      "A: I would say it's about the same intensity as we've seen in the past.,1,1\n",

      "But from H2 revenue recovery, I calculate roughly your IT hardware points will give you a following wind of 60 basis points compared to the first half.,1,2\n",
      "But given that one, I guess, shouldn't expect any change in the European economic environment, maybe you could say a little bit more about where you expect the rest of the recovery to come, calculate you need to get the that flat revenues in H2 to reach your all-new guidance.,1,1\n",
      "And secondly, what else can you tell us about Global Services to reassure us?,2,1\n",
      "I mean, if you look at EBITDA minus CapEx versus cash flow, we're spanning to see a gap opening up again in the quarter.,1,1\n",
      "And also, as you said at full year in the year, what reassurance can you give that that's not a problem of profit recognition?,2,2\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: All right.,1,1\n",
      "I'll let Tony add to this just in a second.,1,1\n",
      "But, yeah, I mean, we had - it's about a 20 million pound hit in Q1 from that point about the - what was going with the, with trade sales and that would drop out.,1,1\n",
      "It's a bit less in Q2, but will drop out in Q3 and Q4.,1,2\n",
      "And also of course, we've got the anniversarying if you recall I think from recollection in Q2 last year, actually our revenue was up because of the 60 million stage payment we had, that we've highlighted there numerous times.,1,1\n",
      "So no great surprise there.,3,1\n",
      "I think also it's the buildup of the investments as add more fibre, as we improve on vision and the other actions we're taking, is the reasons we expect to see materially a better position overall in revenue in the second half.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of Global Services, perhaps Tony, when we said there would be working capital movements this year.,1,1\n",
      "And that's why we expect a lower cash flow.,1,1\n",
      "I think Tony can give you some reassurance on some of the key numbers that show that this is a very different and the main expected issue on cash flow, but that's also different from the fact that we have a more difficult economic environment, but Tony.,1,2\n",
      "A: Nick, the first thing is the working capital is going to bounce around quarter-on-quarter.,1,1\n",
      "That's always going to happen based on things like supply of payments, contract payments, et cetera.,2,1\n",
      "If I looked at the previous two years, we had positive working capital.,3,1\n",
      "You can't have positive working capital every single year.,3,1\n",
      "This year, we're into a , as we indicated previously, we'll have negative working capital.,1,2\n",
      "In terms of your concern, putting it bluntly, what you're saying is that we defer in cost on the balance sheet to improve profitability.,2,2\n",
      "If I look at the quarter four to quarter one movements, there is no movement in terms of deferred cost.,1,1\n",
      "If I look at the quarter one movement to quarter one last year, we've actually got about 150 million reduction in deferred cost.,1,1\n",
      "So, effectively, the balance sheet is materially stronger than this same time last year.,1,1\n",
      "And if I took it back a further year, you'll see similar sorts of reductions.,1,1\n",
      "So this is not a situation where you've got an overhang on the balance sheet that could lead to potential issues.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",

      "And when would the process have an impact, if any, at all?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",

      "BT UK, given these long-term investments, it will not - when we're spending the money, it will not be accretive to free cash flow when we start spending it.,1,1\n",
      "It will be - the expectations in terms of cash flow and profitability include the BT UK debts we've got.,2,1\n",
      "Yeah, I think the comment I made before about BT UK, when we talked about the 2.5 billion that we were spending, we contained that with the new overall guidance about 2.6 billion of CapEx.,1,1\n",
      "If we hadn't been involved in BT UK when we finished about two-thirds of the UK, that number would drop quite materially.,1,1\n",
      "Because we are doing BT UK, it is less likely to do so.,1,1\n",
      "And so it will carry on for some more years.,1,1\n",
      "Probably, if we won all of the BT UK bids, it's a round about 1 billion of our overall money.,1,1\n",

      "So and I think we would look in a couple of places to do that, and at the same time to lengthen them as well.,1,1\n",

      "So, no, there's no change in terms of us not giving you guidance within that.,1,1\n",
      "I think I gave you the overall number.,1,1\n",
      "And then...,1,1\n",
      "Q: I'm just trying to get to get to where that 2.3 billion was more risky because there was no change of issuance, I mean, without knowing what the actual number is.,1,2\n",

      "We said there'll be challenges to the working capital in the Global Services.,1,2\n",
      "We said that was a movement.,1,1\n",
      "So I don't think we commented on the rest of the business.,1,1\n",
      "On GS and EBITDA, I mean, yes, margins will increase in Global - EBITDA margins will increase de facto if we're saying that the EBITDA will increase, and obviously there's revenue pressures.,1,2\n",
      "We need one heck of a turnaround in revenue for the margins not to be increasing in Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "So I think you can take for that EBITDA margins or expect to increase.,1,1\n",

      "Of course, it's about creating a business that generates the sort of free cash flow a market leader should do.,1,1\n",

      "And would you be able to strip out from an Olympics-related cost to improve Openreach margins in the second half?,2,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: All right, and thanks for that.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the lumpiness, there is some additional cost to do with the Olympics.,1,1\n",
      "It shouldn't be dramatically material, but there will be some additional cost we've got incurred.,1,1\n",
      "And I think some focus in there and certainly - but it won't be enormous, but we'll be able to notice it.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of regulation, I think the thing about - if I understand your question right, the EU announcement on regulation was actually - we're really encouraged about it because what it did is very much brought it into line with what the UK position is.,3,1\n",

      "Just on the fibre gross ads, VMED yesterday were trying to essentially imply that most of your fibre gross ads were just up-sell, as opposed to new retail subs.,1,2\n",
      "So I'd like to get your thoughts on that, given the strong adds in the quarter?,2,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, I think you just - in answer to the second question, I think you almost asked and answered it yourself.,1,1\n",
      "Which is, look, I know VMED in their presentations do like to talk about how well they're doing and how people providing it through on the BT network aren't doing well.,2,1\n",
      "Looking at the net numbers, I mean, that's - I mean we can debate about how much we're adding in market three areas , which is we're doing very well.,1,1\n",
      "Where we've got fibre, we see much higher growth.,1,1\n",
      "And this is a comment I've made a number of times, where we've got a much higher broadband growth where we've got fibre than where we don't.,1,1\n",
      "And the net result as you say, we've added 85,000 broadband customers.,1,1\n",
      "I think VMED lost net 10,000 of their on-net customers.,1,1\n",
      "So it's - to be honest that's really, they're not really the discussion point in terms of market growth, as has been for a number of quarters.,1,1\n",
      "I don't think it's going to change, that Sky have - and BT have accounted for over 100% of the market.,1,1\n",
      "And unless Sky come out with their numbers.,1,1\n",
      "But certainly that's been the position for a number of quarters.,1,1\n",

      "Is there a scope perhaps to sort of reinvest in high growth markets?,1,1\n",
      "Or is there a strong business reason for maintaining that southern European presence?,1,1\n",
      "And then the second question is just to do with the second-half revenue outlook.,1,1\n",
      "Given that I guess things look a little bit harder at the H1 stage, is hitting your guidance now I guess putting more pressure on retail perhaps to deliver in the second half than was previously the case?,1,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, I can tell you as I look around the table, when you said put more pressure on Retail - Wholesale, GS and Openreach immediately smiled.,3,2\n",
      "I pointed to Gavin.,1,1\n",
      "No, they all have lots of pressure on them to deliver.,1,2\n",
      "That's not going to change.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, look, the economic conditions do make it more difficult.,1,2\n",
      "There's no question about that.,1,1\n",
      "I think - whilst we didn't expect any massive upturn, I think we didn't expect Europe to be effectively lurching from crisis to crisis.,1,3\n",
      "That's not good for decision-making.,1,2\n",
      "Decision-making is the key thing, for instance, for large contracts.,1,1\n",
      "And people are, frankly, just taking - let's not do anything for the meantime, particularly in - whether it's about technology refreshers.,1,1\n",
      "It's large, transformational things.,1,1\n",
      "People are just uncertain, and that's not good for the economy.,1,2\n",

      "Or are you very much where you thought you'd be at this stage?,1,1\n",

      "A: Well, I think on the tenders, I mean, to be honest, I don't think it's the economy.,1,1\n",
      "I think there's been a number of people who made bold statements, and we're left now with Fujitsu and BT.,1,1\n",
      "And if you look back, if I had a pound for every time I hear that there's someone who's going to transform the UK environment for fibre through massive investment, and then never turns up when it comes to buying their round - it just - people just don't follow through because they realize, when they look at it, actually this is quite difficult.,1,2\n",
      "You need to have - it's a long-term investment.,1,1\n",
      "They haven't gotten - to actually industrialize this takes a long time.,1,1\n",
      "And we started this in 2008.,1,1\n",
      "And in the - it took us a year to plan it, a year to test it, and a year to industrialize it.,1,1\n",
      "And where people are from a standing start makes it very difficult.,1,3\n",
      "And it's not just - a lot of people think it's the physical putting in of the fibre, which is difficult enough.,1,2\n",
      "It's the systems that particularly that go around it, getting the base of wholesale customers and selling to a wide range of people.,1,1\n",
      "And that's something that we are expert in.,1,1\n",
      "So we're very pleased with how we've done so far.,4,1\n",

      "I still don't believe we'll win all of them, but I believe where we win, we'll do a really good job.,4,1\n",
      "And I think the proof in the pudding is just how well we're doing.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the uptick in Infinity net adds, actually it's quite the opposite.,1,1\n",
      "It's actually - we've been provisioned and we've actually had provision resource moving to repair.,1,1\n",
      "So actually, it would have been a bit better had that not happened.,2,1\n",
      "So compared to - we came out of Q4 just generally - this isn't just for Infinity, because it applies all across our business with - actually, our repair book's in really good shape.,4,1\n",
      "Our provision lead times are in really good shape.,4,1\n",
      "And what's happened during the course of this quarter, and particularly in May, June and even now, is we've had a huge number of repairs demand because of very, very wet weather, and also quite a lot of wind, as well.,1,1\n",
      "And we just have to divert resources.,1,1\n",
      "So we've actually got a bigger backlog in provision going into - going out of this quarter than we started.,1,1\n",
      "Q: And on that point, Ian, can you just give us an idea on where you think you can get to, in terms of sort of maximum provision capabilities?,1,1\n",
      "I guess it's going to take some time for fibre to meet DSL volumes and what you can deliver because it's a self-install.,1,1\n",
      "But where are you on the journey at the moment, in terms of reaching maximum?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, we are recruiting more - I mean, I think, importantly, we are recruiting more staff.,1,1\n",
      "We have recruited more staff already to help do that, and that's something we would love to do more of.,2,1\n",
      "We are getting more efficient at it.,1,1\n",

      "And then the summer after, the industry ambition shared between us all, will be to have a single CPE.,1,1\n",
      "So that's kind of what the time windows on that part.,2,1\n",
      "And certainly for some customers, I think the self-install is potentially a big volume opportunity gain.,1,1\n",
      "I think for all of my large-scale customers, combining CPE has got to be an ambition because of course it makes it more attractive financially across the market.,2,1\n",
      "So that's the time windows for those product developments.,1,1\n",
      "I think in terms of demand, demand has followed the steady curve of growth over the last while.,1,1\n",

      "There's more ambition across the market.,1,1\n",

      "Q: Liv, while I've got you, just on that, on the provisioning stuff.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, on the Openreach cost base, was the 2% reduction we saw in the quarter kind of a normal number, given all the weather stuff or - and the repairs you had to do that we expect for the rest of the year?,2,1\n",
      "A: So I guess couldn't give individual guidance by quarter for the rest of the year because no mystic ball in terms of what will happen.,1,1\n",
      "But I think we did a good job to cope with the weather extra and deliver those financials.,3,1\n",

      "I mean, clearly, you're pushing up line rental pricing, but other parts of the bundle there seems to be promotions on - you hinted at maybe tweaks around how fixed to mobile callings inclusive in the bundle.,1,1\n",

      "I mean, presumably this gives you a lot more visibility on the Infinity business case.,1,1\n",
      "And I guess it would help you address some of the calls made by one of your major wholesale customers that your fibre product should be priced regulated from about 2015 onwards.,1,1\n",
      "So I'd just like your observations on that.,1,1\n",
      "And secondly, your result statement trumpets a series of Global Services contract wins included, I note, additional branches of Caixa Econmica Federal, the Brazilian Development Bank.,1,1\n",
      "I mean just if you can help me understand why this is a core competency for BT, and why you are the right person to be providing additional connectivity to extra branches of a Brazilian Development bank.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: All right.,1,1\n",
      "I'll answer the second one because we have a great expertise.,3,1\n",
      "We've got quite to note capability in Brazil, and we've got great expertise in VSAT technology.,3,1\n",
      "If you want particularly to understand why we do, we also do the Brazilian Post Office as well.,1,1\n",
      "So the customers in Brazil certainly recognize our core competency and provide the - Brazil is a different market from others because of the way the fixed line network and the sheer size of the - it's a big country.,1,1\n",
      "And that's why we can provide that.,1,1\n",
      "As well as we got great expertise in financial services sector.,3,1\n",
      "And it's also bringing that expertise and knowledge to national players, as well as international players.,1,1\n",
      "Jeff, anything else you'll be adding to the sales pitch?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I actually would add to that.,1,1\n",
      "I think, if anything, we're probably too quiet about our assets and technology down there.,1,1\n",
      "I think we're doing well in the market, as Ian suggested.,1,1\n",
      "We won our largest transaction last year with the post office down there.,1,1\n",
      "But I am hearing from some of the industry analysts that we're not as aggressive letting our customer know our asset base down there, so we're going to work on that.,1,3\n",

      "Just you know, we had to - I think we discussed this at the last result.,1,1\n",

      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, good morning over there.,3,1\n",
      "Just a couple of quick questions.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly, on Infinity, Virgin Media managed to outsell you three times on high-speed broadband in the quarter.,1,1\n",

      "Is it just a question that you haven't marketed your product to as many customers?,1,1\n",
      "And I'm thinking now that your customer base or your number of lines that are covered by Infinity are broadly similar to Virgin Media's footprint.,1,1\n",
      "And secondly, on Global Services, it's had two years of being operating cash flow positive.,3,1\n",
      "We're now going to go operating cash flow negative.,1,2\n",
      "I know that's not new.,1,1\n",
      "But given the outlook for revenues is probably under more stress than originally perceived, do we think actually that it could be operating cash flow negative for another two to three years because you have to make these investments in geographies that you previously haven't been occupied in?,1,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Certainly not our intent or expectation.,1,1\n",
      "Look, if we look at our retail business its revenues declined, and its profits and cash flow has been increased.,2,2\n",
      "We said to people we knew this was going to be a difficult year in terms of because of the way the working capital was moving.,1,2\n",
      "We saw that in advance, and we said the following year it's improved.,2,1\n",
      "And that still remains our expectation.,1,1\n",
      "And the investment we're talking about in these new fast-growing company, we've actually either have made or are making most of them in the current financial year.,1,1\n",
      "So that's really not the issue.,1,1\n",
      "And we haven't actually said it will be cash flow negative this year either.,1,2\n",
      "So I think there's sort of a presumption, and then many questions.,1,1\n",
      "So, no, it was happening in Global Services from a working capital point of view as we expected, overlaid with I think the economics are worst.,1,3\n",
      "And that's made the importance of self-help even more in Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "And that's exactly what they're working on.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the somewhat bizarre question about the outselling by Virgin, I think they had a forced migration of their customers up to higher speeds.,1,2\n",
      "I would be delighted to be outsold by a company who lost 10,000 broadband customers in a quarter that we gained 85,000, and we gained 150,000 Infinity fibre customers.,3,1\n",
      "It's a remarkable question really.,2,1\n",
      "I don't quite see how any - our performance on any metric in terms of how we're doing on Infinity and actually fibre generally is a multiple better than Virgin have done.,2,1\n",
      "And we are really pleased with the performance.,4,1\n",
      "So long way may we be outsold when we came to see how many times we've had more net ads because when they are negative, we are at positive.,3,2\n",
      "You can't really do the mass.,1,1\n",
      "But I don't really call that being outsold.,1,1\n",
      "So strange question, but thank you for it.,2,1\n",

      "I'm just curious that you beginning sort of continued worries about the economy when you're just suggesting an improvement in the trend for next year?,2,4\n",
      "Or are you expecting quite a significant step change in the revenue trend next year?,1,1\n",
      "Secondly, can you cut the cost transformation slide a slightly different way and comment on what was the cost-cutting magnitude X the cost associated with loss revenues?,2,3\n",
      "And last one, and this is really for Ian.,1,1\n",
      "I know that you share my passion for Scottish football.,3,1\n",

      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: The last one, I thought for a horrible moment you could ask me if I were going to bid for the Rangers.,1,4\n",
      "And...,1,1\n",
      "Q: Please, please do.,3,1\n",
      "A: And I could - I'd like to confirm whilst we traditionally do never confirm or deny acquisition rumors, that is one I am only too happy to deny.,2,2\n",
      "But I'll do a workaround.,1,1\n",
      "I feel I have supported my [indiscernible] and see what they can do.,2,1\n",
      "Q: If they charge you 10 times for everyone that asks more than one question, we'd probably have enough.,1,2\n",
      "A: Or indeed they ask one question.,1,1\n",
      "Scottish football, I have to say, in terms of Scottish football rights, I am completely on it.,1,1\n",
      "So it's actually not - I'm the last person to ask because I am not at all involved in any bidding for - or any thought about Scottish football, for the reason I'm actually on the board with Celtics.,1,1\n",
      "So I don't - I'd defer to leave that very much to Gavin and his team are getting involved.,1,1\n",
      "But actually got - I could honestly answer and say I have no idea.,1,1\n",
      "And long may it remain that way.,1,1\n",
      "Also to answer the cost cutting in the second.,1,1\n",
      "We didn't - just to clear, we've - I mean, you have to calculate your analysis as to what exactly that means in revenue in the second half of the year.,1,1\n",
      "But when then said improving trend, improving trend does not exclude positive.,3,1\n",
      "It can also mean positive in the year after.,3,1\n",
      "And so that's not altered and we think there's a number of football rights, only just one better there.,2,1\n",
      "I think we - I talked about IP exchange, for instance, before.,1,1\n",
      "We got the building up of fibre because actually we've only just got to 11 million.,1,1\n",
      "By the time we speak to you next year, that will be a lot higher.,1,1\n",
      "And we'll have that base to sell into.,1,1\n",
      "So there's a lot of good things happening in that area.,3,1\n",
      "And if you look, excluding the Global Services, actually, we are making that improving trend is coming through in our businesses.,2,1\n",
      "It's hard work in this environment, but actually the hard work is paying off.,1,1\n",
      "But, Tony, do you want to talk about the final saying about costs and cutting it a different way?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, sure.,1,1\n",
      "If you actually look at the slides, what we're trying to do is subdivide the components.,1,1\n",
      "So if you look at the element 123 million, which relates to transit and POLOs , two components, transit which is a straight flow through.,1,1\n",
      "The rest of that box relates to movements in the margins associated with the revenue streams.,1,1\n",
      "And you've got some pluses, you've got some minuses.,1,1\n",
      "And the margin mix changes.,1,1\n",
      "The other 124 million is really outside the revenue streams.,1,1\n",
      "So, effectively, you've got transit flow through, mixes in changes in the margins, capturing 123 million.,1,1\n",

      "We're now seeing Sky pushing fiber much more aggressively over the past months instead of new offers and the others that we've all seen.,1,3\n",
      "I was just wondering, has Openreach seen a pickup in wholesale fiber connections over the last month as a result?,1,1\n",
      "And just a very quick second question, what proportion of your BT Sport customers so far do you think are also Sky TV customers?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: I'll ask Gavin maybe to talk in general terms with the second one in a second.,1,1\n",
      "Maybe - certainly, there has been, we think, a substantial number of customers who effectively have signed up to 12-month contracts with us and who are BT Broadband customers and also Sky TV customers.,1,1\n",
      "And they are, of course, reasonably vulnerable customers.,1,3\n",
      "I'll let Gavin talk more about that.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the wholesale side of things, wholesale fiber, it would be incorrect for me to comment about Sky per se.,1,2\n",
      "I did make a comment that we have seen a growing proportion of the fiber numbers particularly over the last months, six weeks, actually coming from third parties.,1,1\n",
      "And that's encouraging and positive.,3,1\n",
      "And we saw an improvement in Q1, for instance.,2,1\n",
      "It was, I think, about 25% or 26% and that's the improvement.,2,1\n",
      "I think pretty much every quarter; we're seeing that number tick up, and that's good.,3,1\n",
      "So you have to ask Sky tomorrow as to their reaction listening to their advertising of fiber.,1,1\n",
      "But certainly, as you see, they do seem to have been advertising it significantly more over the last four to six weeks.,1,1\n",
      "Gavin?,1,1\n",
      "A: Paul, I'm not going to give you the specific number, but it's the majority of customers that have signed up for the channel so far, signing up to watch it over the satellite platform.,1,1\n",
      "Q: That's very helpful.,3,1\n",

      "A: Whenever you feel fit.,1,1\n",
      "As we said, it was going to be about - headline [indiscernible] is affected by favorable FX.,2,1\n",
      "And I think we've been - we very intentionally didn't make the statement it was the best for 16 quarters because what we try not to do is just pick a number that suits us in different things, because the underlying position is really, you've got to look at excluding FX because they apparently go in one direction or the other.,2,1\n",

      "And of course, Consumers doing better and it hasn't yet had the revenue benefit of Sport.,2,1\n",
      "So as you start to flip these switches really from slight declines to slight increases, I think you'll start to see that coming through in the underlying top line number.,1,2\n",
      "So we're doing what we said we would do in terms of the trend.,1,1\n",

      "Q: Hi.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "Two questions, please.,3,1\n",
      "Firstly, just on the improvement in Consumer and Business call and line decline.,2,2\n",
      "I was wondering roughly what proportion of call revenues are now contracted as opposed to variable.,1,2\n",
      "And also, what proportion of your Consumer customers take an unlimited call package?,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, could you just give a bit more color on the low cash tax?,1,2\n",
      "What read-through that has to the rest of the year?,1,1\n",
      "And also, to what extent did you know about this when you issued your guidance in May?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: On tax, it's pretty much in line with our guidance.,3,2\n",
      "The reason why it's a low cash tax, actually, is because we've overpaid tax in previous years.,1,2\n",
      "We are particularly prudent with the way we pay our tax and it does mean we tend to end up - when you look to prior years, we tend to end up with repayments.,1,2\n",
      "And that's something that we have done.,1,1\n",
      "And that really reflects - that and some settlement to the revenue reflects the situation.,1,1\n",
      "So it doesn't change the guidance that we've got on the overall cash flow.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of proportion, as it relates to contracts and the unlimited, I know Gavin was keen to answer that question.,1,1\n",
      "A: In the Consumer business, it's about 30% on our unlimited packages.,1,1\n",
      "But our strategy continues to be to try and increase that by providing more value for customers and ensuring that they benefit from giving us a contract commitment.,2,1\n",
      "A: I think one of the things that you see in our numbers is just what the little percentage of our overall business is actually making voice calls.,1,1\n",
      "And that actually puts us in a very strong position because we can treat voice in a very different way, I think, from other people.,2,1\n",
      "And as Gavin said, for instance, the SmartTalk application we just incorporated that within an all-you-can-eat package.,2,1\n",
      "And ultimately, the marginal cost per call for a lot of our customers should be zero.,1,2\n",
      "And that, I think, is the direction and something we are trying to move people to.,1,1\n",

      "Bernstein.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Good morning.,1,1\n",
      "We've seen some of your peers that I think introduced vectoring, things like that.,2,1\n",
      "Can you talk about the regulatory and technical challenges you think you might face before you can introduce vectoring?,1,2\n",
      "And then a quick second question, on the regulation side, you talked about the additional costs to be included in the charge control review.,1,2\n",
      "Do you think there's a possibility that the NPS rental fees could actually end up increasing in the financial year 2015?,1,1\n",

      "It could be a small increase.,1,1\n",
      "I would guess a small reduction that will be in the range.,1,1\n",
      "But well, I'll ask Liv to talk about that and also some of our plans for vectoring because certainly, vectoring does present an exciting way of enhancing speed for a number of people in the UK.,3,1\n",
      "And it's something that I think is very important that, for a regulatory point of view, they assist in actually providing the best outcome for the UK population.,2,1\n",
      "A: Thanks, Ian.,1,1\n",
      "So on NPS pricing, as you know, the most recent information we've seen is 0% to minus 6% range.,1,1\n",
      "As Tony said, there's a number of costs on my rental, RPI 0% to minus 6% on last year basis.,1,1\n",
      "As Tony said, [indiscernible] missing costs.,1,2\n",
      "We'd like to discuss those over the course of the summer with Ofcom and are doing so.,2,1\n",
      "I think the end outcome of the [indiscernible] is it would be one way or the other in a small range.,1,1\n",
      "And I guess it'll take a long time for those now.,1,1\n",
      "There are other ancillary costs which currently have some, I guess, downward pressure on them as well.,1,2\n",
      "So I think we'll have to look at the total impact at a revenue level of not just the rentals, but the ancillary costs to be able to understand the total impact [indiscernible] looking into next year.,1,1\n",
      "On vectoring, one of my favorite topics, delighted to have a question on it.,3,1\n",
      "We believe this is a really great technology.,4,1\n",
      "It's something we've been trialing in the labs for a good decent period of time.,3,1\n",
      "We are now heading into live field trials.,1,1\n",
      "We've actually placed orders going down the line that all new cabinets will have vectoring on them.,1,1\n",
      "So we're firmly committed to this.,1,1\n",
      "It's less a, I guess, a lab technology and more a real life thing for us going forward.,1,1\n",
      "So what you will be looking forward to is it's not in a fiber cabinet.,1,1\n",
      "Lucky for us [indiscernible] .,2,1\n",
      "When you do get your cabinet near you, you'll get a vector cabinet, which means that we'll be able to secure even greater speeds in the future.,3,1\n",
      "I think we're comfortable that although we will need to continue to require standards, we will need to make sure that we get the technology right.,2,1\n",
      "We're very comfortable that we've made numerous changes in our technology road map on fiber over the last couple of years and we've managed it as well.,3,1\n",
      "And I think we're comfortable that there is strong European support for vectoring.,2,1\n",
      "And we'll look to make sure that we follow those and that support model to make sure that we can get it synced [indiscernible] .,2,1\n",
      "And I think time windows and time-wise, we believe that we'll be looking to go live with trials imminently in the field to take much bigger scale next year.,1,1\n",
      "Obviously, the major, I guess, the basic continues as we've seen by Deutsche Telekom is what happens at the SLU line.,1,1\n",
      "I think we believe that what we've seen in Germany is a good model, whereby if you do vector an area that you'd expect that you go to compromise situation there with SLU, that's something that we're in discussion, I guess, in the UK route.,3,1\n",
      "The guidance that we all received from Ofcom's recent documentation is that they all support the vectoring.,2,1\n",
      "They were also supportive of SLU.,2,1\n",
      "So I guess it's about working out how the two coincide and we'll be looking to understand that.,1,1\n",
      "I think vectoring gives fantastic benefits in areas for customers.,3,1\n",
      "But I think there's a good argument that vectoring should be encouraged and supported.,3,2\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, in context, vectoring makes 100-meg-plus a reality for people.,1,1\n",
      "And that speed that if you would just think, consider could be achieved there from fiber-to-the-cabinet.,1,1\n",
      "It was just a couple of years ago people were saying we need fiber-to-the-premise to get to 3 megabits per second.,1,1\n",
      "And also, as take-up increases, it also will ensure the performance is good.,3,1\n",
      "So it's very important that actual delivery of vectoring is in no way held back by people saying that one day, they might do something with the cabinet.,1,1\n",
      "And I think from a UK national interest point of view, that's what I would imagine the regulator would want to see a way to achieve that.,2,1\n",

      "I think broadband is at the core of it.,1,1\n",

      "And then secondly, a little bit more - I suppose it's a bit harder to answer, but you mentioned that if the cost base due to the Ofcom ULL price ruling is advanced to 2012 and 2013, that will be favorable to you.,2,1\n",
      "In other words, it sounds like you're expecting the cost to be rising in that period.,2,1\n",
      "Given the hiring and the various other things you've got going on in Openreach, is that another case going forward?,1,1\n",
      "And if so, is there a very big gap between what you think your costs are doing and what Ofcom thinks your price should be doing given what we see in their announcement?,1,1\n",

      "And the fault rates are clear.,1,2\n",
      "The higher quality of service costs are clear.,1,1\n",

      "So I wanted to ask is, are you worried that some of your retail competitors are willing to be at war here?,1,4\n",
      "And is there anything that you can do to set the record straight once you head into government?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",

      "You said that government are unhappy.,1,3\n",
      "Actually, the PAC - nobody in the PAC is in government.,1,1\n",

      "And if you've watched PAC committee meetings, they are clearly designed to attract publicity rather than to get into underlying truth.,2,1\n",
      "And the underlying truth of the situation is we would have loved there to be somebody else bidding for these contracts.,4,1\n",
      "The fact that we are the only people prepared to spend our money for double-digit-year returns, I think, is a [indiscernible] .,1,1\n",
      "And you had actually other - you have one witness there saying the BDUK intervention here was too big.,1,1\n",
      "One was saying it was too small and one saying it wouldn't make any difference, but she thinks there's a margin squeeze.,1,1\n",
      "So they're all saying somewhat different things.,1,1\n",
      "There's a huge amount of available information we provide that we've got a situation where, for instance, in Cornwall where we said we'd provide 85% of fiber.,1,1\n",
      "We've now revised that to 95% because actually, our costs are coming a bit less than expected.,1,1\n",
      "So actually, the benefit all goes to the government.,1,1\n",
      "And the overall situation, one has to look at the overall situation.,1,1\n",
      "The UK is going to end up with well over 90% of the UK having fiber.,1,1\n",
      "It's going to do it for a government intervention that would make Australians cry, because when you look at their sort of size of government intervention, in fact, you look across Europe as a scale of intervention versus the scale actually of delivery.,1,4\n"

      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Two questions, please.,3,1\n",
      "The first one is regarding your broadband market share.,1,1\n",
      "I think you have about 31% broadband market share nationwide.,1,1\n",
      "Are you able to give us guidance on what your market share is in the areas where you've rolled out 16 million fiber premises?,1,1\n",
      "And the second question was regarding your UK Consumer broadband and TV revenues which I noticed this quarter have fallen sequentially for the first time in two years.,1,1\n",
      "And you also mentioned in your release that the 500,000 Sport customers are mostly existing customers recontracting their broadband.,1,1\n",
      "Are those two points linked as new customers signing up on slightly cheaper broadband deals?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, it's also, I think, Consumer broadband TV is up 9%, I think, year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "So I really wouldn't get too - it does - you do get a quarterly sequential number, the number of weeks in the quarter, how exactly various costs are done.,1,1\n",
      "So that said, I wouldn't really be too concerned about that.,1,2\n",
      "In terms on - we won't really talk about installed base, but certainly, we do see much better ads in areas where we've got fiber for BT Retail.,2,1\n",
      "We've definitely done a lot better in broadband in areas we've got fiber.,2,1\n",
      "And then, Gavin, do you want to add anything more than that?,1,1\n",
      "A: I was just going to say, I mean, the ARPU gets affected by the timing of Easter every year.,1,1\n",
      "So that's one thing to bear in mind.,1,1\n",
      "And as Ian said, there's nothing of particular concern in the way the ARPU is going across the Consumer business.,1,2\n",
      "We'd expect that trend to continue going forward.,1,1\n",
      "And while we don't give out the numbers, I think typically, we're going three times as fast in areas we've got fiber rolled out as we are in areas that we haven't.,1,1\n",
      "So that's another point [indiscernible] .,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "Q: positive side with customers recontracting?,3,1\n",
      "Are they now signing up for some of the higher-end packages when they're calling into your call centers?,1,1\n",
      "A: I mean, when we're upgrading people to fiber, we find that - we use that as an opportunity to sell people on the benefits of the top tier.,1,1\n",
      "So we do improve ARPU at point of sale quite significantly.,2,1\n",
      "It's not a number we've given, but it is part of the strategy.,1,1\n",
      "And you do see that coming through in the numbers.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Next, question.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "O: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Next question, John Karidis, Oriel Securities.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Two questions, please.,3,1\n",
      "Firstly, can you talk about the phasing of the marketing cost within BT Retail during the year and indeed relative to the first quarter?,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, always sort of struck by the contrast between yourselves talking about retail pricing not being inflationary.,1,2\n",
      "And the likes of Sky and TalkTalk on the other side, however, saying that it is in inflationary and it's actually BT that's allowing them to increase prices.,3,1\n",
      "So I wonder if there's anything that you can comment on on this issue, please.,3,1\n",
      "A: Well, I thought we've talked really about inflationary or not inflationary.,1,1\n",
      "But I will say you have seen in line and occasional call prices, you have seen sort of probably inflation-type rises.,1,2\n",
      "But actually in other areas such as broadband, you've seen customers getting a lot more for the same price.,1,1\n",
      "So the actual value for the customer has been significantly higher.,2,1\n",
      "Now we have our ARPUs gone up.,1,1\n",
      "And the reason our ARPU has gone up is people are trading up to higher specifications.,1,1\n",
      "They're adding more to their packages.,1,1\n",
      "So we've seen a 5% increase roughly on ARPU year-on-year.,1,2\n",
      "So that's strong in that way.,1,1\n",
      "But customers are getting a lot more for their money.,1,1\n",
      "The UK has seen a substantial reduction in real prices over the last 20 years in telecoms and, as I said earlier, is one of the cheapest markets in the Western world.,1,2\n",
      "So I think people are getting more for the same as a sort of as I would probably express it overall.,1,1\n",
      "And that's the situation.,1,1\n",
      "Obviously, if TalkTalk and Sky want to talk about increasing their prices, I hope they'll be telling customers much the same.,3,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "O: Next question from the line...,1,1\n",
      "Q: In terms of marketing?,1,1\n",
      "A: In terms of marketing, yes, sorry.,1,2\n",
      "Well, we've done in the overall numbers in terms of - roughly - the overall cost of Sport, 40 million this quarter and about 100 million next quarter.,1,2\n",
      "The next quarter we start to amortize the programming cost in there as well.,1,1\n",
      "Obviously, marketing is weighted towards the first sort of half of this year.,1,1\n",
      "But I think beyond that, we're not really going to give any further splits on it.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thanks, Ian.,1,1\n",
      "Good luck.,3,1\n",
      "A: Thank you very much.,1,1\n",
      "O: Next question is Guy Peddy, Macquarie.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead, Guy.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning, everyone.,3,1\n",
      "Just a couple of quick things.,1,1\n",
      "I picked up on your commentary and you talked about fault lines or faults on lines increasing, A, because of weather but B, because of capacity demand.,1,2\n",
      "Can you just talk a little bit through that because I thought Infinity and fiber, et cetera, should reduce the number of faults?,1,2\n",
      "And secondly, probably a question for Gavin, given it's going to be difficult to interpret the success of BT Sport on Infinity in the short term, should we, therefore, watch BT Vision customer numbers over the next two to three quarters as it reads for how many incremental customers you're actually adding to the BT platform from BT Sport?,3,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, no.,1,1\n",
      "Actually, we - Guy, we actually answered that question already.,1,1\n",
      "We said actually, probably if you had to take outside the old tradition or sort of things of top and bottom line growth over the long term.,1,1\n",
      "We said the thing probably that was - the two things to look out was signups and broadband.,1,1\n",
      "And that's what we said, was that probably we felt - because people might well sign up to Sport, but actually run it on Prince's satellite.,1,1\n",
      "So that wouldn't affect our TV ads but it would - either they pay for it or they'll take broadband from it.,1,1\n",
      "So it's actually broadband, not the TV ads which is the critical thing.,1,2\n",
      "So overall, Sport signups and, I think, broadband numbers would be [indiscernible] .,1,1\n",
      "In terms of faults, it's not about capacity.,1,2\n",
      "It's about if you start running more and more speeds over a particular network, it just shows up faults more.,1,2\n",
      "And particularly, people are using it more and more for - and more and more, shall we say, demands of it.,1,1\n",
      "So sometimes, small issues in the network, things in the past when they would just look at their e-mails and it was running a bit slower occasionally, it was a problem, they wouldn't be too bothered.,1,2\n",
      "But now, when they're running many more services over it, they would call out for a fault.,1,2\n",
      "Fiber-to-the-cabinet is not inherently more - have less faults.,1,2\n",
      "Actually, you increasing your broadband speed overall tends to increase the faults for the reason I said before.,1,2\n"

      "And I'm wondering if you could just give us any detail on how great your opportunity is to offload mobile capacity through Wi-Fi.,3,1\n",
      "And then just a quick second question.,1,1\n",
      "Given the majorities who signed up to BT Sport is satellite TV, does that indicate a more targeted approach to sign up those types of customers by you or is it just a much greater demand from that type of customer?,3,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: I think what the second one actually reflects is the people who are signing up tend to either have actually just beginning before the services started.,1,1\n",
      "You tend to get some of the people who actually don't have to change anything.,1,1\n",
      "In the case of satellite TV or if they've already got BT TV services, it's a very, very easy upgrade for them.,1,1\n",
      "They don't have to do anything much which makes sense.,1,1\n",
      "And that's what we thought would happen before the service started.,1,1\n",
      "So I think it reflects customer response actually.,1,1\n",
      "It's not particularly a targeting.,1,1\n",
      "In the case of mobility, I mean your question failed to mention the fact we bought rather a lot of 4G spectrum.,1,3\n",
      "I think we did very well in the spectrum option.,1,1\n",
      "And that 4G, we think, will allow us to develop - and the same we talked about in Strategy Day, very much an indoor-out strategy.,1,1\n",
      "So it isn't just Wi-Fi.,1,1\n",
      "It's that 4G spectrum.,1,1\n",
      "But if you want to talk about Wi-Fi, the billions of minutes - the 4 billion roughly minutes of use in Wi-Fi in a quarter, I think that highlights the sheer degree of offload and the fact that tablets - and I'm sure yours does it.,1,2\n",
      "First of all, look for Wi-Fi and only then does it goes to 4G.,1,1\n",
      "But we'll combine that with our 4G spectrum.,1,1\n",
      "And we've got, although not on the spectrum, if you recall clearly, and we've got about, I think, 10% or 11% of all spectrum now in the UK.,1,1\n",
      "And what we'll do is develop that with our - combined with the fact we've got a lot of broadband lines into customers' homes and businesses, which effectively creates a very low-cost backhaul.,1,3\n",
      "We can put together a very strong indoor network offering that would be really data focused.,1,1\n",
      "And when people are out and about, they can roam on our MVNO.,1,1\n",
      "So I think there's a great opportunity for us actually organically in mobile.,3,1\n",
      "And I'll refer you to our strategy presentation where we went through some of the opportunities in that.,1,1\n",
      "And that certainly remains the case.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "O: The next question is from the line of Jerry Dellis from Jefferies.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Thank you for taking my questions.,2,1\n",
      "I've got two questions, please.,3,1\n",
      "Firstly on TV, YouView seems to have been less of a focus so far.,1,1\n",
      "I wondered whether that is deliberate and whether, perhaps, the launch of multicast channels next week is the precursor maybe to stronger TV net ads.,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly in terms of Retail, if I sort of eliminate from your headline EBITDA numbers the TV cost that you incurred in the quarter, it would appear as though underlying EBITDA growth at the Retail level grew around about 8.5% year-on-year.,1,2\n",
      "And the trend has been sort of 3% to 5% over previous quarters.,1,1\n",
      "And even if we look at sort of the OpEx trend ex-TV to eliminate the pricing effects, it still looks as though the sort of the OpEx space at Retail is falling anywhere between 4% and 6% year-on-year over most of the recent quarters.,1,2\n",
      "So I just wondered really what is going on within the Retail base that is enabling such a strong cost reduction and to what extent that's sort of sustainable over the next 12 months or so.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, I think with regards to the performance of Retail reflects outstanding management and which I'm sure we can bring to the group as a whole.,3,1\n",
      "But Retail has been reducing its cost base by that sort of mid-single digit to slightly more for now seven-and-a-bit years.,1,1\n",
      "And you're quite right to say if we hadn't done TV, you would continue to see that.,1,1\n",
      "And one of the things we haven't sought to do is the - our profits excluding investments are really this.,2,1\n",
      "And we knew you'd be interested in an investment number, but I know some other people will start to try and exclude your money they're spending on investments.,2,2\n",
      "And they're - but we actually think our job is to pay for it with the cost transformation program.,1,1\n",
      "What you've seen in retail, I think, good numbers in BT Business, strong profit growth there, top line growing.,3,1\n",
      "Of course, the Consumer top line is - it's only 1% decline, which is a lot better.,2,2\n",
      "And Enterprise in Ireland.,1,1\n",
      "So the answer is all the bits of the Retail are doing well, and effectively that's paying for the last quarter the investment we're making.,1,1\n",
      "But Retail continues to show cost transformation and also the investments we've made in the past, what they can drive in terms of improvement.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of YouView, you're right.,1,1\n",
      "Multicast is coming and that's over YouView.,1,1\n",
      "And I think we'll make a particularly attractive package.,2,1\n",
      "I think our focus on YouView is slightly different from some other people.,1,1\n",
      "And I may ask Gavin to say more on this.,1,1\n",
      "But we're focused, I think, on a package that actually increases our ARPU, that people are spending money getting services because we - and we incurred this in the early days of BT Vision.,1,1\n",
      "You want customers who are committed to some of the subscription because if they're not, you find that they have pretty [indiscernible] characteristics.,3,1\n",
      "And so, I think we've learned that lesson in time past and we're focused on sort of slightly different sort of customer needs [indiscernible] YouView.,1,1\n",
      "But Gavin, do you want to add anything to that?,1,1\n",
      "A: I think the only other thing I would add is that in Q1, our focus is very much on Sport rather than TV per se.,1,1\n",
      "You need to get some focus.,1,1\n",
      "You need to get some critical mass behind your marketing efforts rather than necessarily splitting it between a number of different messages.,1,1\n",
      "And that's what you see, to some extent, in the numbers.,1,1\n",
      "To Ian's point, I think as we go into this quarter with multicasting coming online, I think you got a very strong proposition for customers.,1,1\n",
      "We know that channels in conjunction with on-demand content at a very keen price is something that customers want.,1,1\n",
      "And we can see that in the early results we've got, both in terms of the early sales and the customer satisfaction around it.,2,1\n",
      "So I think you'll see that change going forward.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "And multicasting is very, very good.,4,1\n",
      "I mean, the HD channels are actually better than broadcast.,2,1\n",
      "So it's actually an excellent proposition.,3,1\n",
      "Which leads, I think, to the final question.,1,1\n",
      "So James, I think that falls to you.,1,1\n",
      "O: James Britton, your line is open.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: You're both very kind.,3,1\n",
      "Ian, the final question for you.,1,1\n",
      "No pressure.,1,2\n",
      "I was actually going to ask Tony, but I'm sure [indiscernible] .,1,1\n",
      "But what wager terms have you been able to agree with the unions for this year and next?,1,1\n",

      "Can you just explain why that fiber demand has stalled a bit this quarter?,1,2\n",

      "It's from a low base but it's been declining for quite some time.,1,2\n",
      "Any change in trend there or is it just a bit of volatility?,1,2\n",

      "But briefly on customer line loss within the Consumer business and John, chip in if I miss anything here.,2,3\n",
      "The trend is - there's nothing new to see in that trend.,1,1\n",
      "There is some seasonality in the Consumer market we see generally in this quarter, but I think all providers see some seasonal churn that comes with - at the end of the academic year and the moving season.,1,1\n",
      "And, of course, this is probably going to be the quietest quarter in terms of BT Sport, which has been a key driver for reducing line loss in the Consumer market.,1,3\n",
      "It's the quarter of the year when we have the - probably the least content.,1,1\n",
      "So, there's nothing to be seen here.,1,1\n",
      "I think you can overall, look at the strength of the Consumer business and our strong performance based in revenue and EBITDA growth.,1,1\n",
      "Less than a year, after we launched BT Sport, you can see the performance on broadband net adds, you can see the fibre net adds.,1,1\n",
      "This strategy is working very well for us, and we will continue to see it driving the business going forward.,1,1\n",
      "And then, anything else on that, John, you wanted to mention?,1,1\n",
      "A: No.,1,1\n",
      "Just to say, year-on-year looks, it actually strong.,1,1\n",
      "So, given the seasonal point that you mentioned that the losses year-on-year have more or less halved actually.,1,3\n",
      "So that's the big difference that we're seeing here.,1,1\n",
      "And the trend in Q4 to quarter one, that's the seasonal pattern that we see every year.,1,1\n",
      "A: Tony on pension.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Just worth adding on the consumer line loss.,1,3\n",
      "I mean, the average for last year was 77,000, whereas it's 69,000 now.,1,1\n",
      "So actually it's less than the average for last year.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the longevity spot, look, there's no cash involved, but the payments, it's inbuilt into what's happening.,1,1\n",
      "Commercially, it makes sense, and I don't see it coming back to it at a later stage.,1,1\n",

      "Q: I'm sure Carl will come soon.,1,1\n",
      "A: Hi, Steve.,1,1\n",
      "Q: I've got a couple of questions, Gavin.,1,1\n",
      "The first one is on BT Sport and I guess as you head into your biggest quarter, maybe can you give us a little color on some of the lessons learned last year in terms of maybe how you did your pick?,1,1\n",
      "How you marketed all this fibre and television and whether you made - changed those levers a little bit this year without giving away all your commercial secrets, interested to hear your thoughts on that?,2,1\n",
      "And secondly, a more sort of strategic question.,1,1\n",
      "I guess your two biggest competitors have made some interesting moves in the quarter.,1,1\n",
      "Sky obviously is expanding into Europe, Liberty buying a stake in ITV.,1,1\n",
      "Just interested to hear, how that influences your thinking and whether you - in terms of your current content position, whether it sort of kind of validates your strategy, whether it's going to make you think, other things may be needed.,2,1\n",
      "Interested to hear your thoughts on those deals.,2,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "John, do you want to talk a little bit about learnings from the last year with respect to BT Sport and any thoughts you have for the year ahead?,3,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Sure.,1,1\n",
      "If I pick up on the point in terms of pick, first of all, and there is lots of chatter out there around the science of pick.,1,1\n",
      "But the reality is there are few factors that we look at.,1,1\n",
      "With respect to fan basis of a particular team, if the teams are playing at home or if they're playing away, getting the balance of picks right across the season, there are various factors that you have to hit in terms of the minimum numbers of games per club.,3,1\n",
      "And you're going to have a spread of strong matches across the season as well and, of course, there is a news factor too that, for example, the first match of this season is the first game for Louis van Gaal, so that's very newsworthy and gives us a very strong start for the season.,1,1\n",
      "So there is a variety of factors here.,1,1\n",
      "I think in terms of - our start for this season, we're extremely pleased that we picked - that we have, the first portion of this season and we're looking forward therefore to a very strong start to BT Sport.,5,1\n"

      "I think in terms of lessons learned, I mean clearly we're coming from a place where it feels as though we're building on success.,3,1\n",
      "I think the key focus for the advertising is to get to those Premier League fans that haven't, to make decision to switch to BT Sport, really through pointing out the strength of them, of some of the fixtures that we had last year and that's been the focus of the advertising that you've seen to-date.,1,1\n",
      "But taking BT Sport in the round this year, combination of the total rights that we have including the European rugby, as Gavin said, including a full season for MotoGP too.,1,1\n",

      "So I think the overall offer to the customer is going to be stronger and we'll make the most of that.,1,1\n",
      "More broadly, you're right, there's obviously some quite interesting moves going on in the market with Sky and Liberty.,2,1\n",
      "I think it demonstrates that the integration of content and distribution is finding a new lease of life.,1,1\n",
      "And I think that perhaps certainly looking at the comments Liberty have been making about the investment they'd be making, amongst others, all3media and now this stake in ITV.,1,1\n",
      "It's always worth bearing in mind, Virgin is only in 50% of the UK in terms of what's coveraged.,1,1\n",
      "And the model that ITV requires - has got a lot of revenues dependent on the advertising market as well.,1,2\n",
      "These are factors I'm sure they're taking into account.,1,1\n",
      "And with Sky, this has been I think long debated in terms of their moves with Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland.,1,1\n",
      "It's going to be something that's going to, I mean extra things they've got to focus on in the year ahead.,1,1\n",
      "I'm sure neither of those businesses are going to be easy to integrate, and that means that possibly they will have a lot on their plates.,1,1\n",
      "So ultimately, there's no surprises here.,1,1\n",
      "For us, in terms of what it means, we made a very deliberate choice to focus on sports.,1,1\n",
      "We knew when we made that choice that it was the lever to pull to really influence the purchase decision within the household.,1,1\n",
      "More broadly, on general entertainment, I'll reiterate the point we've made in the past, we can get access to pretty much everything we need with the exception of the Sky Basic's channels.,3,1\n",
      "But we can mitigate to some extent that impact by looking to exploit things like buy-to-own - the buy-to-own window in movies, for example, and more broadly, content relationships with a wider range of over-the-top players.,2,1\n",
      "So, the rest of the entertainment market, the non-sport part, I think, works reasonably well at the wholesale level.,2,1\n",
      "And we'll continue to strengthen our position in sports as and when rights become available.,1,1\n",
      "If we can get them at a good fair price; we'll continue to be disciplined about that.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Does it make you feel [indiscernible] balance sheet?,1,1\n",
      "I mean, Liberty is very levered, Sky is more levered now [indiscernible] the balance sheet.,1,1\n",
      "Do you see that as a real sort of strength against your [indiscernible] ?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, I mean, it's clear that they are loading up, and there is clearly the opportunity to borrow more in the market.,1,1\n",
      "For us, we're very focused on the strategy we've set out for you.,1,1\n",
      "We're clear we want to increase our dividend by 10% to 15% a year over the next couple of years.,1,1\n",
      "We want to pay down our debt to get to a number beginning with five because we think, ultimately, that will give us a BBB+ rating.,1,1\n",

      "And ultimately, we will continue to invest in this business.,1,1\n",

      "I mean, obviously, Wholesale is facing a lot of challenges currently that you highlighted in the presentation.,1,2\n",
      "Summation of most of those, you would expect it to ease or annualize in time.,1,1\n",

      "Look, there may be something in it in the UK, we'll look at it more closely.,1,1\n",
      "It's too early to say.,1,1\n",
      "What I would say is that the legislation around REITs is different between the US and the UK.,1,1\n",
      "And I'm not optimistic we will have the same flexibility that they have in the US So, I wouldn't get too excited about this if I were you.,3,1\n",
      "If I talk about Wholesale, maybe I'll give a couple of opening comments and suggest that Nigel gives a little bit of color.,1,1\n",
      "Is that all right?,1,1\n",
      "I mean it is a tough quarter for Wholesale.,1,2\n",
      "It is a continuation in many ways of some of the factors influencing the business we've seen over the last year.,1,1\n",
      "There is a quite radical change going on in the market.,1,2\n",
      "The Wholesale market per se is declining.,1,1\n",
      "I think we're competing very well in the parts of the business that are growing, particularly the IP-related parts.,1,1\n",
      "And you can see that in IP Exchange which is delivering tremendous numbers quarter-on-quarter.,4,1\n",
      "You can see that in our Ethernet numbers.,1,1\n",
      "But set against some of these regulatory headwinds, which are massive chunks off the top or bottom line, it can look as though the business is pretty unwell.,3,1\n",
      "So you need to look through that.,1,1\n",
      "And just to remind you, of course, that we chose to terminate the Post Office contract, and that's got to anniversary out of the business which we've got this quarter and maybe a little bit next quarter I think.,1,1\n",
      "So, that's what the business looks like.,2,1\n",
      "We are a committed wholesaler.,1,1\n",
      "We continue to be a committed wholesaler.,1,1\n",
      "We will be able to navigate our way through these trends.,1,1\n",
      "And as our customers move to an IP world, we'll make sure that we're providing the right range of products and services for them.,1,1\n",
      "So, Nigel, anything else you wanted to add to that?,1,1\n",
      "A: The only other one thing I would add is about the order intake profile.,1,1\n",
      "Because in Q1, actually the underlying rate of small orders that we created and received were basically consistent with the long-term trends within the business.,1,1\n",
      "But actually we didn't renew any of the larger smaller in number deals that we have on the books, and we're currently creating with customers.,1,1\n",
      "Those larger deals are few in number and tend to oscillate volumetrically as the year unfolds.,1,1\n",
      "So that the picture is driven by those two characteristics: strong underlying consistent performance in the smaller deals, but no significant renewals of big customer contracts.,1,1\n"

      "And I think a significant element of that reflects the impact of the amount of money that you received from the government.,1,1\n",
      "I'm just wondering, going forward, do you think expectations in the market are right for that number or could there be more positive surprises around that?,3,1\n",
      "And just also thinking kind of longer term about the CapEx numbers, that a couple of companies globally reported CapEx numbers were quite a bit better than market expectations, and they've highlighted the fact that there are quite a lot of cost savings coming in in terms of new developments around technology.,2,1\n",
      "And I just wondered is that something that you would concur with in terms of thinking about the longer-term trends.,1,1\n",
      "Separately, just a second on the Business side of things.,1,1\n",
      "There does seem to be a little bit of a better picture coming through in terms of the UK macro and historically, that's been used as a kind of a reason why perhaps the BT Business element has been softer in the past.,2,1\n",
      "I'm just wondering, looking at the performance that we've seen, in that context, perhaps it is not coming through strongly than I might have expected.,1,1\n",

      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Three parts there, I guess.,1,1\n",
      "The first piece is, the level of BDUK subsidy that we get from the government and if you look at the net position that we're spending on fibre and compare what we've done in Q1 this year with Q1 last year, it's almost identical.,1,1\n",
      "So effectively, the commercial rollout and the rollout for the BDUK footprint, their net spend on that is roughly the same.,1,2\n",
      "Second one is in terms of where we are in the quarter, capital spend is going to drift quarter-by-quarter.,1,1\n",
      "I wouldn't read anything into it.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of longer term trends, I would expect our capital to be broadly in line with where we were last year and the reason why is we have got efficiencies coming through.,1,1\n",
      "We'll continue to make savings, but we'll continue to reinvest.,1,1\n",
      "We have to materially accelerate what we're doing in terms of the speed and the quality of our network and that will need investments.,1,1\n",
      "So I wouldn't read too much into what's happening elsewhere.,1,1\n",
      "We know we have to invest in our business moving forward.,1,1\n",
      "A: And then I'll say some opening comments on Business, then maybe I'll ask Graham and potentially Luis just to give a little bit of color on the UK market.,1,1\n",
      "I think there's a couple of things to see in the numbers.,1,1\n",
      "There is a trend for all customers to move from traditional voice to IP voice and SIP-based voice, and that comes with inflation and you'll see that coming through our numbers.,1,2\n",
      "That is a market-based trend.,1,1\n",
      "That's what our customers are choosing to do.,1,1\n",
      "It's giving them better flexibility with the products, and we will move with them and help them build their businesses in an IP world.,2,1\n",
      "In the IT services side of things, we are focused on the service element and not the hardware element.,1,1\n",
      "So, we're continuing to change the mix of this business and move away from chasing one-off kit sales to moving the mix more to annuity-based revenues and that's the key number for us.,1,1\n",
      "So, that's the annuity-based side of things, the services-based side of things in the Business market was up double-digit year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "And, I think the other factor is there was a particularly big one-off in Q4 and part of Q1 last year that is not helping the comparator in that area.,1,1\n",
      "And then, anything else you want to just mention on - there's one thing I wanted to mention on Global Services but...,1,1\n",
      "A: No, Gavin.,1,1\n",
      "There's probably just a couple of other things worth noting.,1,1\n",
      "I think, if you look at your KPIs, as well, you'll see our voice component of Business would be still relatively substantial at about a third of our revenues, which would be higher than the average mix within the UK market.,1,1\n",
      "And those lines volumes and calls volume is still declining at 8%.,1,1\n",
      "And so that has an impact.,1,1\n",
      "And also Gavin had mentioned earlier that some of the legacy businesses we have around payphones and directories so you have a slightly different business mix.,1,1\n",
      "But the competitor also in IT, where we - it went bust last year that we benefited from, we benefited in Q4 and Q1, and that will disappear in Q2.,1,1\n",
      "A: And then on GS.,1,1\n",
      "As I mentioned in my comments earlier, some of our public sector revenues, we signaled, we expect it to decline significantly.,1,2\n",
      "And I mentioned Lancashire - contract we've had with Lancashire County Council, where our customer decided to take a number of associates in-house and you can see that in our numbers.,1,1\n",
      "That's a significant chunk.,1,1\n",
      "And if you take that out, basically, the UK business is reasonably good, I think.,3,1\n",
      "Luis, is there anything you want to add?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",

      "As Gavin said, we think the value that market has - the addressable market here is between 6 billion and 7 billion of which we have about 1% at the moment.,2,1\n",
      "We've obviously got relationships from a fixed perspective with a share around 40%.,1,1\n",

      "Specifically, with One Phone, we're bringing together calls, lines, network, mobile and PBX.,1,1\n",

      "A: Look, just to reiterate, I mean we think there are many flaws in the methodology.,1,1\n",
      "We think there's many flaws in some of the assumptions that they're making.,1,1\n",
      "So, we will be challenging all of those.,1,1\n",
      "And the basic premise that we have to recover the cost of our investment over the lifetime of a Premier League contract seems to not encourage challenge and competitiveness in the content market.,1,2\n",

      "That said, we're confident we would meet any test, and that's the way we operate the business.,2,1\n",

      "Premier League has been very important to our first year as a channel.,1,1\n",

      "As of next season, of course, we'll have Champions League and Europa League on an exclusive basis on the channel, and that means we aren't as dependent on the Premier League as we would have been if we didn't have that, and that was in the hands of our competitor.,2,2\n",
      "So, we can afford, I think to be extremely disciplined going into the auction, and we'll have a very clear view on the outcome we want, and we'll bid accordingly if we choose to bid at all, of course.,1,1\n",
      "So, I feel confident we're in a good place here, and we won't allow some of the assumptions that are going into this ex ante test to go unchallenged because we think that's fundamentally wrong.,3,2\n",
      "The last thing to mention, of course, is if, if we needed to, we can change the pricing model.,1,1\n",

      "So, I was wondering whether there's any way in which BT might also position itself to take advantage of that capital or perhaps things that you could proactively do to convince these local councils that they don't need to subsidize, challenge FTTH deployments.,1,2\n",
      "A: We are - I mean we're very clear on our strategy and we're confident that we can access capital at the right price to deliver it.,2,1\n",
      "It's worth noting that the latest coverage of fibre across the UK is 82%.,1,1\n",
      "And I think even in Europe, which is where the first of the rollouts is going on for the CityFibre were 89% covered with fibre including 11% of fiber-to-the-home.,1,1\n",
      "And I think even cable is there in 42% of homes.,1,1\n",
      "So I admire the challenge.,3,2\n",
      "I think they've chosen quite a challenging place to start.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of access to capital, we have no concerns about access to capital in our own business.,1,2\n",
      "I think local authorities have to be very careful, of course, because the state aid test that get applied in this area and any case that would suggest that those are not being adhered to is obviously something we're going to have to look at very, very carefully.,2,1\n",
      "And there has been one or two examples of this over the last few years.,1,1\n",
      "There was one in Berlin, for example.,1,1\n",

      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "Well, I'll add some opening comments and then I'll ask Tony to give a little bit more of the moving parts, if I may.,1,1\n",
      "As I said, the GS number in the quarter was a little disappointing, but it doesn't reflect what we believe will happen over the year as a whole.,1,3\n",
      "So, we may remain confident that over the medium term that this business will continue to grow both top and bottom line, although it's clearly got some headwinds in front of it at the moment.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the quarter itself, as I said, there are some big contracts that came to an end, in the health service space in particular.,1,1\n",
      "And some of the new contracts that we've taken on have some of the costs turning up in the quarter and it's a little more lumpy than some of our other businesses.,1,1\n",
      "But if you look ahead, some of the headwinds that we've talked about in the past begin to come out of the base and our continued focus on cost transformation and margin, in particular, give us the confidence that we'll be able to deliver growth in this business going forward.,2,1\n",
      "So, Tony, if you want to just add anything else?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, Gavin's got the majority of the points.,1,1\n",
      "I just think a couple of things though.,1,1\n",
      "The headline numbers in there, you need to just be conscious of.,1,1\n",
      "So, when you look at the EBITDA decline headline 11%, if you take into account the impact of FX that brings it down to 7%.,1,2\n",
      "And if you then take the impact of the movement from leavers from below the line in specific items to above the line, it's about a 7 million swing in Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "That takes the underlying decline to 3% to 4%.,1,2\n",
      "So, it's important that you look at this base point .,1,1\n",
      "In terms - there are two issues then.,1,1\n",
      "So, that headline number is not as bad as it prima facie appears on EBITDA.,1,2\n",
      "The second piece then is why would the run rate improve?,2,1\n",
      "We know that we have to focus on Global Services within the UK.,1,1\n",
      "It's something that we've been doing during the course of the last 12 months or so.,1,1\n",
      "In the evolution that we've got at the moment, we are looking at what we're doing and we've already started making some changes in relation to the organizational structure and the consolidation of that.,1,1\n"

      "A: That was certainly part of it.,1,1\n",
      "But it's simply around - the game is organized, so it kind of works best for our customers and best for our business, because, for perspective, for the Champions League it's necessary for us to recruit quite a few people for customer service and for sales.,2,1\n",
      "It kind of wouldn't make sense to recruit those people for the Champions League peak then let them go, then hire new people and do the pricing announcement later on.,2,1\n",

      "And if we can provide that with deals like AMC, then we might look at others in the future.,2,1\n",
      "But at the moment we're happy with what we've got.,2,1\n",
      "John wants to add something else.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "I just wanted to say that although the wholesale market for entertainment does work better than sport, that is a very, very low benchmark, because there are still lots of anti-competitive practice that we see from Sky such as most favored nation clause in the contracts that can not only dictate Sky's cost base, but actually affect the cost base of other players and have an exclusionary effect.,2,3\n",
      "So there are still issues too from a competition point of view as well.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",

      "Q: ...a question about - good morning.,3,1\n",
      "I wanted to ask a question about phasing, please.,3,1\n",
      "First of all, in terms of the regulatory price cuts and the impact on Openreach, you said 40 million in the first quarter.,1,1\n",
      "Is it still the case that we're expecting something like 90 million for the full year?,2,1\n",
      "And what will be the phasing of that?,1,1\n",
      "And if possible to extend this to the phasing of leaver costs over this year, that would be great, please, in terms of which quarters are likely to be heavier versus others?,4,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Tony, do you want to sort of open up on that?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "So, our overall profile on our guidance in terms of what's happening on regulation hasn't changed.,1,1\n",
      "It still stays as intact.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the phasing in relation to leaver costs, it very much depends on how our programs work.,1,1\n",
      "We gave an initial guidance of 100 million.,1,1\n",
      "We put through 16 million in the first quarter.,1,1\n",
      "There's nothing that's happened that will change that.,1,1\n",
      "But as I said, I think it's worth emphasizing on the leavers, it is a volatile number.,1,2\n",
      "If we can do a little bit more on in-sourcing, we may not need to spend as much on leavers if we can - and, therefore, it will be variable.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Right.,1,1\n",
      "I'm sorry.,1,2\n",
      "Can I confirm the impact on Openreach is 90 million for the full year and the first quarter was 40 million?,1,1\n",
      "A: Joe, do you want to...,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "At the Openreach level, we have absorbed all the significant impacts of regulation in the first quarter, so there's not huge amounts still to come through.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Lovely.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Our guidance remains unchanged.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "O: Moving on, next question, Andrew Lee, Goldman Sachs.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning, everyone.,3,1\n",
      "Just another question around the promotional activity, just because your TalkTalk flagged it and you've mentioned it quite a lot too during this call.,1,1\n",
      "Can you just talk - give us a bit more color around how much worse is this really compared to, say, two years ago, and do you expect it to abate through the year?,1,3\n",
      "Do you think the expectation of your Champions League launch is the key driver of this or is there something more sustainably pressure happening here?,1,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Just to underscore, Andrew, what I've said today, it's - there's a lot of promotional activity going on out there.,1,1\n",
      "But if you want to grow your customer base, there's still a scope to do that and I think you can see that in our numbers.,1,1\n",
      "85,000 broadband net adds in the quarter, 217,000 fiber net adds in the quarter, that's 57% share of the market.,1,1\n",
      "That's a decent performance overall.,1,1\n",
      "The market tends to be a wee but quieter across the summer in general; as you know, the bigger quarters of Q3 and Q4, or our Q3 and our Q4.,1,2\n",
      "But in a nutshell, I think it is competitive, I think there's plenty of promotional activity out there.,1,1\n",
      "But it's not fundamentally different than it has been in the past and, as you say, I don't think it's dramatically different than it was at this point a couple of years ago.,1,1\n",
      "John, is that a fair reflection?,2,1\n",
      "A: Yes, I think it is.,1,1\n",
      "And the comment from TalkTalk seems somehow to suggest that there was an exceptional spike of activity and they nobly stood apart from it.,4,1\n"

      "And that's without any above the line marketing.,1,1\n",
      "That was largely direct marketing to a part of our base.,1,1\n",
      "So, we've got confidence in the fact - built our confidence in the fact that there is a market for cross-sell of mobile into fixed and that as consumers have multiple SIMs, not just for their own use but within the family, there's a natural buying behavior that we can market towards.,2,2\n",
      "Our offer is, I think, very well priced.,1,1\n",
      "It's not crazy in terms of its pricing, but it's very competitive, we think.,1,1\n",
      "I think we wouldn't go into the specifics of the mix, but it does skew towards the lower of the tiers.,1,1\n",
      "But from a profitability perspective, we're very comfortable in where we are, I think, and we're not concerned in the same way that I know TalkTalk were concerned by their offer.,3,2\n",
      "But, John, is that - anything I missed there, really?,1,2\n",
      "A: Just a couple of points I was going to make, and this was that first of all, there's been a bias in demand towards existing BT customers taking these packages first off.,1,1\n",
      "And that's a beneficial factor here, we believe, because it consolidates those overall customer relationships.,1,1\n",
      "Secondly, it's quite frequent that we're seeing our typical household taking more than one SIM.,1,1\n",
      "There's a fair amount of that happening as well.,2,1\n",
      "Most customers are taking the smaller data bundles, Gavin, as you said.,1,1\n",
      "But it's a part of our offer that customers get to trade up easily between the packages so as to avoid overage charges.,1,2\n",
      "And the final bit of perspective to give is that this has been a gradual below-the-line entry into this marketplace to ensure our customer experience is absolutely right, first of all.,1,1\n",

      "The customer satisfaction from our mobile customers is absolutely great.,4,1\n",

      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: From our perspective, we are pleased that we've met the original forecast that we had which was - the case was built on 20% take-up and a mixture of CPs both our own and, more broadly, across the market were expected to deliver that.,3,1\n",
      "And I think it's worth just reflecting on a second.,1,1\n",
      "When we made the investment originally in 2008, I think is when we announced it, but 2009 was when we started selling, it was a pretty ballsy assumption.,3,1\n",

      "And it was - we were launching this in the middle of a recession and a very tough recession.,1,3\n",
      "So, it is worth reflecting, I think, for a second, saying, well actually, that's not a bad accomplishment.,2,2\n",
      "We've hit the number we thought.,1,1\n",
      "And there's still momentum in that business in the market going forward.,1,1\n",
      "We're calling that we can see 28% from this point.,1,1\n",
      "When that happens will depend largely or to a large extent on how the other CPs, apart from our own, if they continue to market it in the way they have been in the last year.,1,1\n",
      "And it's something that's they've clearly seen demand in their own customer bases for fiber and you can see that in the sense that we're now of the order of 50/50 in terms of market share within the quarter between BT's CPs and other CPs.,1,1\n",
      "And that's really what we wanted in the first place.,1,1\n",
      "So, having shown a lack of interest in it in the early years, they've certainly decided that their customers actually wanted it after all.,2,2\n",
      "The last thing I wanted to make as a point was, while we've hit the 20% mark, it is worth remembering that the payback is still double-digit years.,1,1\n",
      "So, we are several years off to be getting our money back for the original investment and that is the point we will continue to make to Ofcom in any future regulatory discussions.,1,1\n",
      "We went into this investment with the basis of it being a fair bet.,2,1\n",
      "If we were going to put several billion of our shareholders' money at risk, it was only right that we had a chance to make a return on that.,1,2\n",

      "Q: Hi.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you very much for taking the question.,2,1\n",
      "I really wanted to sort of understand a little bit more about what's going on, the order intake in some of the - you've talked about the cyclical impact already, but order intake in a number of areas does actually look like it's worsening.,2,3\n",
      "Are you just seeing a general slowdown or which - though nothing to do with Brexit but just a general slowdown?,1,1\n",
      "Could you just talk about what's going on, particularly Business and Public Sector looks quite weak in terms of order intake Global Services.,1,2\n",
      "I know you've talked about some of the contracts and not being affected by Brexit.,1,1\n",
      "So, I just want to understand a bit more about the order intake dynamics.,2,1\n",
      "Because business and enterprises are sort of an area in some of the other telcos in Europe, TVC, KPN, some others which are seeing some big secular pressures as we move from sort of traditional services to new IP-based services.,1,2\n",
      "I'd just like to understand a few of the dynamics there please.,3,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "I'm going to ask Graham and Luis perhaps to add a couple of words, but from my perspective I think what we're seeing is on the corporate side, be it major business, SME or SOHO, actually the business is strong.,1,1\n",
      "It is - and the order book is pretty good.,4,1\n",
      "The order book does move around a little bit.,1,1\n",
      "It can be pretty lumpy depending on where the deals in - big deals in the base line period, because they don't come through at a regular rate.,3,1\n",
      "But if I look at the sense of the business and its predictability, actually in all those markets it's looking good.,3,1\n",
      "The drag, and we called it out in the Capital Markets Day, is the public sector business where big contracts are coming to an end.,1,2\n",
      "And we will work through that over the next couple of years.,1,1\n",
      "We've reorganized our business to take advantage of what we think will be the way procurement moves moving forward.,1,1\n",
      "Moving more regional, looking to leverage the full range of products and services across multiple segments that we can offer in the UK, taking full advantage of the integration of Mobile as well.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think we're well positioned as the market turns, but ultimately that's going to take a year or two.,1,1\n",
      "So, Graham, do you want to talk on UK Domestic to start with.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "A: Business and Public Sector, and then Luis on Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you, Gavin.,2,1\n",
      "There's probably three things worth saying in terms of the Business and Public Sector division.,1,2\n",
      "We've had - over the last couple of years, we've had a couple of very substantial renewals and they're long-term five, seven-year contracts, particularly in the Republic of Ireland.,1,1\n",
      "So, they obviously don't repeat on a regular basis.,1,1\n",
      "We've also lost or discontinued three public sector contracts, they're very sizeable and therefore we didn't have any renewal order from those.,1,1\n",
      "But if you strip that out, the actual underlying position is relatively strong.,1,1\n",
      "And we're seeing that, yeah, particularly with ex-public sectors, we're seeing it with strong growth in both our SME and corporate markets.,1,1\n",
      "So, underlying business is strong.,1,1\n",
      "A: Luis?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, thank you.,2,1\n",
      "I think that if you look to a couple of years ago, we are around 20% above two years ago and against last year, there's a little bit of variability because there was a very large deal.,1,1\n",
      "We've seen quite a strong performance all across the regions.,1,1\n",
      "We are very pleased with the results.,4,1\n",
      "I think that there we have seen customers continue to give us confidence.,2,1\n",
      "As we've mentioned, Michelin, and some of the others, is that we have announced today and over the quarter.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think that there is still quite a good performance in terms of the order intake.,3,1\n",
      "And the pipeline looking ahead looks pretty solid as well.,3,1\n",
      "A: And, Gerry, anything from the Wholesale market?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, in wholesale, there was a tough comparator with the last quarter and the corresponding quarter last year with an EE order that came in.,1,2\n",
      "So, there's a significant change there.,1,1\n",
      "But overall, the pipeline - and you look at a long run is actually - is not significantly different.,1,1\n",
      "I don't think there's anything to concern there.,1,2\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you very much, guys.,1,1\n",
      "That's very helpful.,3,1\n",
      "A: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Who's up next?,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Your question comes from the line of Simon Weeden from Citigroup.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "You're live on the call.,1,1\n",
      "A: Hi, Simon.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Good morning, thank you for taking the call.,2,1\n",
      "Yeah, so, I guess I have a couple of questions.,1,1\n",
      "One is whether you see scope for variations on what legal separation of Openreach could mean.,1,1\n",
      "So, for example, whether or not it's binary, whether or not Openreach directly employs all its staff or directly owns all of its assets for example.,1,1\n",
      "And on broadband, if I could add to this - the line of questions on that, we seem to seeing a slowing in the market as a whole.,1,1\n",
      "The market share seems to be holding up quite well but is this sort of - I know you've addressed this in different ways, but I think this is a different question.,1,1\n",
      "Is this slowing of the market something that is the new normal?,1,1\n",
      "And when do we likely hear more from you on the deployment of G.fast?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "I'm going to ask, certainly, Clive, John, and I don't know whether you wanted anything, on the market on broadband in a second.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of incorporation, I'll just repeat what I said at the beginning of the day, I don't want to conduct negotiations in public around the future of Openreach and the governance around Openreach.,1,1\n"

      "There are clearly a range of different variants of incorporation.,1,1\n",
      "And Ofcom, as I said, we're very clear that they do not want to significantly increase the costs that Openreach has to incur.,1,1\n",
      "Because unlike other industries, we do not get to reclaim the pension payments to repair the deficit in the charge control that we offer.,1,2\n",
      "So, I think that's a very sensible position.,1,1\n",
      "We will discuss a range of different solutions with Ofcom, and hopefully we'll be able to come to a sensible, pragmatic, sustainable way forward.,1,1\n",
      "Market views, Clive, what's your sense?,1,1\n",
      "A: So, the underlying, I do believe customers over time will migrate to higher-speed services.,1,1\n",
      "Now, the reference point for me is a ADSL2.,1,1\n",
      "Just in rough numbers, only 50% of ADSL2 customers can receive 10 megs, right?,1,2\n",
      "As customer use of broadband increases, as applications demand higher bandwidth, as the propensity to stream high-definition video continues to increase, I think there will be inexorable pressure to move customers to a superfast then ultimately, an ultrafast platform.,1,2\n",
      "So, I think all the underlying reasons why growth of the customer base on superfast, all of those underlying reasons are not going away.,1,1\n",
      "So, I do believe we'll build and continue to build.,1,1\n",
      "If you add to that, our footprint is extending.,1,1\n",
      "Almost 25,000 new homes every week can now benefit from the platform.,1,1\n",
      "I think those underlying forces will keep the numbers moving in a healthy way.,1,1\n",
      "If I could then switch, if I may, to the G.fast...,1,1\n",

      "We've made our supplier selection.,1,1\n",
      "We've laid out what we term our pilot plans so, these are significant scale pilots in Kent and Cambridgeshire.,1,1\n",
      "Our intention is to put in a platform footprint of 25,000 homes passed in Q3 of this year and to launch thereafter.,1,1\n",
      "So, we're very positive about what G.fast will achieve.,4,1\n",
      "It is a mechanism for us to deliver an ultrafast platform at real pace to a very large number of people in the UK.,1,1\n",
      "And the plan is on schedule to the dates I've just given you.,1,1\n",
      "A: Thanks, Clive.,1,1\n",
      "John, any other observation?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, just a couple of thoughts.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly, the household penetration in the UK, it's pretty high already.,3,1\n",
      "So, at some point, the number of the new households taking broadband, that was bound to start to slow down.,1,1\n",
      "There is a seasonal aspect to this though that we said, and typically our quarters three and four are generally bigger quarters.,1,1\n",
      "But the real trend here, I would say from the retail point of view, for some years this has been primarily a switchers market.,1,1\n",
      "And the services that BT is selling through its several brands compete very well in that switchers through differentiation and through competing at different price tiers.,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, the point I made earlier, in terms of the underlying trend that we see is for bandwidth users is to increase very substantially year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "And just as Clive was saying, that it shows the demand for better broadband, the fibre broadband, is extremely strong.,2,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "We've got time for one more question.,1,1\n",
      "This is the final question.,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Your next question comes from the line of James Ratzer from New Street Research.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",

      "Thanks for making it the last question.,2,1\n",
      "Hope I can live up your expectations then.,3,1\n",
      "So, two please.,3,1\n",
      "One is - I mean, we've now owned EE for six months, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on how you are funding the idea of cross-selling, both in the Business and also in the Consumer market?,1,2\n",
      "And secondly, I noticed leaver costs in the quarter were up quite sharply year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "I was wondering if you could help us give us a stir on how leaver costs should pan out for the rest of the year?,1,1\n",
      "Many thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",

      "And then maybe, Graham, a word on cross-selling the business market.,1,2\n",
      "Luis, if you've got anything out from your perspective.,1,1\n",
      "John, Marc, just a couple of words on each.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Leavers, the position on leavers is actually a good news, because it means that we're progressing well in terms of our rationalization programs.,3,1\n",
      "The GBP 40 million we incurred is not - I wouldn't go with that number all the way through.,1,1\n",
      "I think we'll have - it'll obviously reduce because we're trying to get the savings in early.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Cross-sell in SME and Corporate in the UK, Graham?,1,2\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, I think that the early signs are very positive.,4,1\n",
      "We've obviously fully integrated the teams and improved their coverage and distribution, and we're seeing increased acquisition both on fixed and mobile, so early signs are positive.,3,1\n",
      "A: Luis?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I think that the customers are really accepting very well and they're very supportive on using both.,3,1\n",
      "I think convergence is really driving that and we have seen the both in the financial services sector as well as some of the other large brands.,1,1\n",
      "And the increased use from data I think is quite important - a way of driving this cross-sell, so it's working really well.,1,2\n",
      "A: John?,1,1\n",
      "A: The approach on cross-sell for the Consumer market is very much to use of the most effective brand for the right customer.,1,2\n",
      "And so typically, and for BT Broadband customers, the approach is to cross-sell the EE Mobile network, who use the BT Mobile brand.,1,2\n",
      "I think you can see the postpaid net adds and to the broadband market share under this strong trading momentum.,1,1\n",
      "There's one exception to that, and that is BT Sport being - obviously, given to EE customers now, and I think that's a strong offering that fits logically for consumers and it's going to be a good things for Marc's business hopefully.,3,1\n",
      "A: Nice segue, Marc?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, great segue, John, thanks.,3,1\n",
      "Yeah, I was going to say the highest profile example we've got launched today.,1,1\n",
      "So, BT Sport in EE, that's a great example.,3,1\n",
      "And we're learning a lot across the businesses on home and Mobile as we share knowledge and that's helping us achieve best practice in both areas.,2,1\n",

      "I might ask John just to comment on how the convergent propositions have been developing, but just a word on how the broadband market is developing, first of all.,1,1\n",
      "The summer months, the two summer quarters tend to be the quieter quarters.,1,1\n",
      "There is a seasonality in the marketplace, first of all.,1,1\n",
      "And secondly, over time, we are going to reach saturation of broadband penetration.,1,1\n",
      "I know we've been talking about it for a while.,1,1\n",
      "But we are going to get, in the next couple of years, a point where there is no more market growth, I think, in broadband.,1,1\n",
      "Now, anticipating that, we're increasingly focusing our business on loyalty and retention and driving ARPU growth and RGU growth as a way of driving profitability for the business.,2,1\n",
      "And I think that's true both in the Consumer business and the EE business today, and you can see that in the more for more strategies that we're operating in.,2,1\n",
      "Now, even in a relatively quiet broadband market, by the way, we still got over 50% market share, 53% market share per se.,1,1\n",
      "Then I think in terms of physical line loss, there's probably a little bit of a lightening effect around the edges.,1,3\n",
      "But ultimately, this is to some extent, I think, an indication potentially of a couple of things.,1,1\n",
      "One is some mobile-only penetration as particularly where there's a trade-off, and we've seen this a little bit in the past where there's, particularly in some of the lower-income households, there is a trade-off between mobile and fixed.,1,1\n",
      "And then I think we've seen that cable have come back strongly in Q4 and to some extent Q1 at a time when some of the brands that were operating on the Openreach network were executing price changes.,1,1\n",
      "And I think you can see that a little bit in the numbers.,1,1\n",
      "So, we can manage the business through these trends, so we're very confident about that.,3,1\n",
      "But increasingly, I think it means that we focus on creating extra value and driving additional penetration of the products and services over and above the ones that we have already.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the convergent proposition, John, do you want to say anything about it?,1,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "Yes.,1,1\n",
      "On the convergent proposition, so there's currently a discount of 5 on the BT Mobile price for BT Broadband customer.,1,1\n",
      "And that proposition works very well.,1,1\n",
      "But it's worth - and that's performed particularly strongly this quarter.,1,1\n",
      "And it's worth just making a couple of observations on it though.,1,1\n",
      "First of all, if you take the price of a quad play from BT and a quad play from EE, although the mobile is lower, got a headline price from BT thanks to that discount, the combined price and for quad play from both brands is actually, in fact, quite similar.,2,1\n",
      "And I think there's sort of - and the perspective I would give on this is that it's important to maximize the advantage that we have from convergence and from quad play.,1,1\n",
      "And there's more that we can do on this I think in the future.,1,1\n",
      "But, at the same time, this is not around driving low price propositions that are going to provoke a competitive reaction.,1,2\n",
      "That would be a mistake.,1,2\n",
      "It's about preserving value in the marketplace, and at the same time, giving a benefit to our existing customers.,2,1\n",
      "I think, finally, there's more we can do in terms of value-added benefit through converged network, for example, the BT Wi-fi network is an asset and there's more we can do with, for example, to create those converged propositions.,2,1\n",
      "So, I think you should expect to see more from us on this in the future.,1,1\n",
      "But the focus is on sort of preserving the value of the customers.,2,1\n",

      "Hi, Gavin.,1,1\n",
      "I had a question on regulation, the Ofcom and the CAT decision earlier in the week.,1,1\n",
      "I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunity for adjustments to the Ofcom regulatory decisions in the WLAR.,1,1\n",
      "I mean you have a new Head of Regulatory Affairs, but do you have an open and an ongoing dialogue with Ofcom on that given that it's still in the consultation phase?,1,1\n",
      "And other regulators across Europe we've seen have moved to rule out material cuts to fiber-to-the-cabinet and copper prices because they don't think that incentivizes further investment.,1,1\n",
      "Ofcom doesn't speak to the investment community to anywhere near the extent that other regulators do.,1,1\n",
      "So, I was just wondering if you could give us your insight as to the scope for them to adjust these decisions.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Interesting question, Andrew, and I might ask Clive to comment as well on this.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, first, on the CAT decision, we're very happy to hear the preliminary CAT conclusion this week, which concluded that Ofcom had erred or made mistakes in terms of the way they defined the markets in the Business Connectivity Market Review.,3,2\n",
      "I think it's a little too early at this stage to say what will happen from here.,1,1\n",
      "We need to see the full judgment to understand exactly how they came to that conclusion.,1,1\n",
      "And then, there's a process that you need to go through where the CAT create an order based on consultation with CPs, and that should happen I think in around about September.,1,1\n",
      "But at a headline level, we're very happy because we've always felt as though that some of the decisions were made in the wrong way.,3,2\n",
      "In terms of the ongoing relationship with Ofcom, I would say that it is good and getting better as we come out of the DCR.,3,1\n",
      "A couple of points on that, Ofcom's final conclusions around the DCR came out in the quarter.,1,1\n",
      "And I think they're pleased with the progress we're making around creating independent governance around Openreach, the formation of the board, the branding, the improvements in service that they've seen and the ability for Openreach, and Clive in particular, to consult his customers in a confidential phase are some of the things they talked about in that.,3,1\n",
      "And then I think more generally, in terms of the discussions around wholesale line access, I feel we're having a good open dialogue with Ofcom on this matter.,3,1\n",
      "We're looking to make a fair return for the investments that we've made and that we want to be able to recover costs around increased service in particular and ensure that investments that we've made in superfast broadband allow us to make a fair return.,2,1\n",
      "So, the starting place on that is we don't think we've actually got to that point yet.,1,1\n",
      "And that the fair bet has not been honored, and that's one of the points we've made.,2,1\n",

      "When I take out the six contracts that you've shown in the presentation, it looks like the underlying Public Sector and major Business revenues are down about 3% and were the same last quarter.,2,1\n",
      "So, you're reasonably happy you've got a handle on the other business now.,2,1\n",
      "And is regionalization starting to benefit you a little bit, not just attract.,1,1\n",
      "And the second one was on the GS order book.,1,1\n",
      "Order looked a little bit weak.,1,2\n",
      "North America was weak as well.,1,2\n",
      "How much of this is market conditions and how much of it is maybe you pulling back from some of the more far-flung regions now?,1,1\n",

      "Well, I'll let Graham talk about BPS and what that looks like, and then I'll make a comment on GS.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning.,3,1\n",
      "No, I mean I think from a revenue perspective, around half the decline now is due to effectively three Public Sector contracts now.,1,2\n",
      "And you can see that from the chart on the slide.,1,1\n",
      "And obviously, at an EBITDA level at minus 6%, the bulk of that is now down to those three contracts as well.,1,1\n",
      "And also, within the quarter, we've had our best ever quarter on mobile, very strong but that's brought with it some quite high acquisition costs.,2,1\n",
      "So the underlying EBITDA position is pretty solid.,3,1\n",
      "Also, order intake is we've had a very, very strong quarter.,1,1\n",
      "Obviously, we have one very large Wholesale deal in there.,1,1\n",
      "But, excluding that, what's there is a progression of the strong double digit order intake increase that you saw in Q3 and Q4.,3,1\n",
      "So, Q1, which can be quite a soft quarter, has actually been pretty strong from an order perspective.,3,1\n",
      "And I think that's just reinforcing a lot of the work we've done on the ground to build our distribution and our capability and we'll continue to do that.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think Q1 has been largely in line with what we expected.,1,1\n",
      "A: And then on GS, I think it's fair to say the international markets are proving to be, proving some headwinds to I think everybody not just GS and its customers at the moment.,2,1\n",
      "What we're seeing is the sort of the type of contracts and the mix of contracts is changing.,1,1\n",
      "There are more smaller contracts and fewer sort of three-digit contract values in the market.,2,1\n",
      "That said, we did sign up a number of significant names in the quarter.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of what's happening in the Americas, it's a trend of one particular client who is - I think we've talked about it in previous earnings calls, who is insourcing a business that they had with us for a number of years and which was a very profitable piece of business for us.,3,1\n",
      "So, you'll see that wash through the numbers in the next 12 months, and then it will be out of the base.,1,1\n",
      "At an underlying level, we're confident we remain competitive in Global Services and we are well-placed to help navigate the sort of technology trend that comes with software-defined networks - and that we're able to launch those services for our customers because they're beginning to look for them now.,2,1\n",

      "Thanks very much.,2,1\n",
      "Just a question on the roaming point that you made.,1,1\n",
      "Is there any more clarity you can give us on roughly what you're paying per gigabyte when customers roam into the European Union just to give us a sort of idea of the scale of the headwind that might occur the following year as well, obviously, because mobile usage continues to go up?,1,2\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Simon, do you want to comment on that?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I'm not going to give you the specific prices on what we're paying.,1,1\n",
      "But I think what we have seen is a significant growth in volumes internationally from our customers, something like three times, I think.,2,1\n",
      "And that's obviously impacted our costs.,1,1\n",
      "And then, obviously, on those coming inbound, we are facing a price squeeze.,1,1\n",
      "So, you all have seen - we guided to the impact of EU roaming to be in the high 10s, and that's a little higher.,1,1\n",
      "If you were watching our wording carefully, you'll see we're more in the mid-10s previously.,1,1\n",
      "So, we are seeing a bit of a upward cost pressure really on the back of increased volumes.,1,2\n",
      "Q: So, while we're on pricing, if I could just have a quick follow-up on broadband.,1,1\n",
      "You mentioned that the churn settled back.,1,1\n",
      "Obviously, when anyone looks at the prices in the market, there's a huge spread between BT brand and Plusnet and some of the other brands.,1,1\n",
      "How would you characterize the stability of that market structure right now between the sort of top-end brands and then the cheaper ones?,1,2\n",
      "A: John, do you want to?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Shall I take that?,1,1\n",
      "So, I think the persistent trend over time has been for people to promote very aggressively on the front book and, at the same time, take pricing opportunities where they can and I actually see more continuity than change in that regard.,1,4\n",
      "And I would draw your attention to probably TalkTalk's pricing policy, in particular, because they've clearly spoken publicly about the importance of getting back to growth and competing for those lower price segment customers.,1,1\n",
      "But, at the same time, they have just put the price up for their back book of customers too.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think the same equations always apply that this is down to all of us to deliver value for the customer.,2,1\n",
      "And certainly for BT customers, it's not just a matter that the service should be more expensive and has to be more for more, too.,1,2\n",
      "And that's why things like the service improvements that we've made, the higher [indiscernible] from Openreach, the faster speeds too, that's why those things are so important.,2,1\n",
      "Q: So, in the mobile market, what do you see in market?,1,1\n",
      "Any comments you'd like to make about how this sort of pricing spread is working between the premium brands versus the value brands?,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean our approach is we talk about more for more.,1,1\n",
      "We've been including more content and services for our customers, as well as an improved customer experience, things like 100% UK call centers, more stores in order to deliver more personal service for our customers.,2,1\n",
      "And that is allowing us and enabling us to justify small premium in the marketplace, which is as you can see showing through in our revenue growth numbers this quarter and the prior quarter.,1,1\n",
      "Still remains a very competitive market and we're certainly seeing polarization of customers, more customers moving to SIM-only and we're performing well in the SIM-only market.,1,1\n",
      "But polarization of SIM-only versus handset and I think we're well-placed across the brands to deal with the changes that we're seeing in the marketplace.,1,1\n",

      "A: To answer the first question, are we seeing a sort of impact of a tightening of the economy?,1,1\n",
      "Maybe around the edges, but I don't see it as significant at this point.,1,1\n",
      "I think what we have is a portfolio of brands that allows us to operate in different segments of the market.,1,1\n",

      "I think we're - the addition of mobile into our proposition business in Public Sector is proving to be very strong and I think that's one of the things you're seeing.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of network quality, I think we are seeing that network quality is beginning to make a difference to customers, both in terms of the resilience and the quality of the network itself, the coverage of the network.,1,1\n",

      "Well, thanks, Simon.,2,1\n",
      "So, I covered our CapEx outlook in my remarks.,1,1\n",
      "And just to remind you, our existing capital plans, which I think are fairly reflected in the sort of market's view, include currently significant investment into the completing of the rollout of the VDSL platform and 4G.,1,1\n",
      "And then, if you look out over the coming years, we see that investment sort of ramping down and that creating space in our CapEx envelope to invest in our ultrafast program.,1,1\n",
      "So, that's the 10 million G.fast and the aspiration to get to 2 million in FTTP.,1,1\n",
      "That's our existing capital plans.,1,1\n",
      "The consultation that we're undertaking, which is exploring the market demand for the economics of a larger rollout of FTTP, we need to see the results of that consultation to understand what the potential timing might be, the extent to which it mixes or substitutes against the balance of G.fast, these are the questions that we were resolving over the process of the consultation.,2,1\n",
      "And of course, the WLA review outcome is extremely important in guiding that.,1,1\n",
      "So, there are scenarios certainly in which we can see opportunities to invest in a more expensive FTTP rollout and if we saw that attracting a good return for us, we would prepare to lift our CapEx envelope to drive value creating investment for the business and we are comfortable that we have got the balance sheet strength to be able to do that while maintaining our commitments to shareholders and indeed to the pension fund.,3,2\n",
      "A: And on GS, we are moving ahead with restructuring the GS business, focusing on multinational customers, not putting the same priority into our domestic businesses, particularly the ones with the network assets outside of the UK, looking to help our customers move to the next generation of technology, simplifying the service experience.,1,1\n",
      "So, we're getting on with that restructuring now.,1,1\n",
      "As with any part of our business, we continue to look at whether or not we have the right asset mix going forward, and GS is the same as any other line of business in that respect.,3,1\n",

      "We did try to flag the slowdown in Q4 when we gave results.,1,1\n",

      "We also had some milestone payments on a large contract, which didn't - none of those landed in Q1 which had an effect.,1,1\n",

      "I think that's a reasonable description.,1,1\n",
      "Bear in mind this is on a asset base that has actually performed well over multiple years.,1,1\n",
      "And, of course, the slight decline in the assets was compensated to an extent by decline in the liabilities, which was registering an increase in the real discount rate.,1,3\n",
      "The other thing to bear in mind, of course, is that the valuation date for the triennial valuation is, of course, June.,1,1\n",

      "And ultimately, I think, he wants to go and do something else.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Next question is from Sam McHugh from Exane.,1,1\n",
      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Morning, guys, and thanks for the questions.,2,1\n",
      "Just two for me.,1,1\n",
      "On the Consumer side, I think if we look at the net adds, 19,000.,1,1\n",
      "I think I'm right in saying that includes BT, Plusnet and EE.,1,1\n",
      "Can you clarify whether the BT brand is actually now losing subscribers, and whether you've seen the gross addition mix shift in the last 12 months?,1,3\n",
      "Then secondly on capital allocation for Simon, if I look back at BT's capital allocation over the last eight years, dividend payments have pretty much broadly been equal to pension top-up payments.,3,1\n",
      "Now, if I look at consensus going forward, we have a significant discrepancy with much higher dividends and lower top-up payments.,1,1\n",
      "Are you comfortable with that, especially in the context of much higher deficit, higher spending on Sport, more fiber-to the-home CapEx, and also as you go to the union today and discuss reductions to employee benefits?,2,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Sam, I'll let Simon give you a response to the second question.,1,1\n",
      "The first one very briefly, we've always given an overall share across all brands that we operate in the market.,1,1\n",
      "And while the market is a little softer than it has been for previous years, we're very happy with the 53% market share we have.,3,1\n",
      "We don't break it out by brand.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks, and in terms of capital allocation, obviously, as I described, we look to the allocation of our cash flow starts with seeking value-creating reinvestment in the business.,2,1\n",
      "That is good for our shareholders by driving long-term value.,3,1\n",
      "It is also good for the pension fund because it creates and strengthens the long-term value of BT and the strength of the covenant.,3,1\n",
      "We then look at balance allocation of the residual cash flow between different stakeholders.,1,1\n",
      "We are absolutely committed to our progressive dividend policy.,3,1\n",
      "It's important that our shareholders who are funding the long-term investment and growth in our business receive an attractive return on that investment.,2,1\n",
      "We're committed to that and the pension fund understands the importance of that.,1,1\n",
      "And then, in terms of the pension deficit payments, we will negotiate those and agree those, that funding plan with the trustees and we have to recognize that the debt at any one point in time is volatile.,1,2\n",
      "It depends on volatile measures, such as real interest rates, and we need to come up with a sensible funding plan for that.,2,2\n",
      "And we look at those two in a balanced fashion and look at it over the long term.,1,1\n",
      "And I'm not going to prejudge the outcome of the discussion with the trustees.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Next question.,1,1\n",
      "Q: That's very clear.,1,1\n",

      "I'll go for a couple.,1,1\n",
      "First, I just want to come back to regulation and some of the points that Clive was making earlier.,1,1\n",
      "And I want to ask whether you think that you're confident the current regulatory framework as it stands today is kind of able to allow you to invest in FTTP.,2,1\n",
      "And maybe just get Clive to spell out what is required to give you that confidence.,2,1\n",
      "Is it, as you said, some relief from the WLA?,1,1\n",
      "Is it spelling out how long the fair bet actually applies for?,2,1\n",
      "Is it possibly including FTTP into the RAV and allowing other products to kind of pick up the slack whilst you invest in this project over time?,2,1\n",
      "It'd be good to hear that.,3,1\n",
      "And if the framework doesn't exist, do you think there may be political appetites to get involved to facilitate this investment?,1,1\n",
      "So, few things are there I'm afraid but I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on that, particularly from Clive.,2,4\n",
      "And just on EE, very good numbers there particularly on postpaid mobile.,4,1\n",
      "Can you just confirm that you haven't got any funky handset financing in there, split contracts, upgrade plans?,1,1\n",
      "I don't think you do.,1,1\n",
      "But as you move to IFRS 15, I guess you're going to have to recognize handset revenues upfront.,1,1\n",
      "Might that change the way you think commercially in the market and the offers you put out there?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks a lot.,2,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Clive, briefly on what you need to make the case work for FTTP, and whether or not within the existing framework, you feel as though we can make that work.,1,1\n",
      "And then Simon wants to talk about funky handsets.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",

      "I think it's fair to say that, as we look at FTTP, we certainly would be open to thinking about whether there are different constructs that might make sense.,2,1\n",
      "And I think that's a discussion that may flow from the consultation.,1,1\n",

      "Yes, good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "First question I had was just regarding G.fast, please.,3,1\n",
      "So, a couple of questions on that.,1,1\n",
      "I mean you've said in the press release, you've got 550,000 homes now passed on superfast.,1,1\n",
      "I was wondering if you could give us a kind of timeline on how that can grow over the next 12 and 24 months.,2,1\n",
      "And then also, I mean, you could get quite a nice revenue uplift on G.fast with the wholesale price you've set at between 11 and 15 a month.,3,1\n",
      "How long is that do you think in the fair bet fall?,2,1\n",
      "When do you think that price comes under charge control?,1,2\n",
      "And then the secondary I had was going back to I think the very first question asked around the line losses in Openreach.,1,3\n",
      "One of the issues you mentioned, Gavin, was some of the kind of cable price promotions that was obviously kind of signaled by Virgin in your Q4, but were kind of suggesting that was going to abate this quarter.,2,2\n",
      "I mean are you suggesting you are still seeing that and, therefore, cable line losses have been a driver and maybe, therefore, if that does abate, the Openreach line losses albeit negative could slow a bit in the future quarters?,1,3\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "I'll let Clive comment on both of these.,1,1\n",
      "But just to make sure everybody's clear, the 550,000 number I quoted earlier was for ultrafast coverage.,1,1\n",
      "We've got about 100,000 in terms of take-up there.,1,1\n",
      "And our ultrafast plan covers FTTP and G.fast.,1,1\n",
      "We've always said that we're a mixed technology strategy and between now and 2020, we expect the G.fast rollout to get to around 10 million and another 2 million on top is the goal for FTTP, so 12 million in total.,1,1\n",
      "So, I don't know whether there's anything specific around G.fast in terms of the pricing and the sort of goals for the next 12 months you wanted to talk to there, Clive?,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "So, just to emphasize that we've been in the trial phase having deployed a footprint, an initial footprint for G.fast.,1,1\n",
      "We've been in the trial phase proving the technology, understanding how best to deploy it.,2,1\n",
      "We've done that with multiple CPs, hundreds of customers for multiple CPs.,1,1\n",
      "In the autumn, we moved to a pilot phase.,1,1\n",
      "We've announced pricing and the prices is keen.,1,1\n",
      "So, it is designed to entice the CPs to launch product on top of G.fast.,1,1\n",
      "And over the course of this year, you will see the footprint deployment increase quarter by quarter, right?,1,1\n",
      "So, we are building a ramp of deployment on G.fast.,1,1\n",
      "And I think that's what I wanted to say on G.fast.,1,1\n",
      "I think on line losses, I think we've said it's seasonal.,1,3\n",
      "We said there are multiple drivers of line losses and the kinds of loss that we've seen in the quarter just completed is probably indicative of the level on the average for the year.,1,3\n",
      "A: Right.,1,1\n",
      "I might just add that - there was a question about the fair bet in terms of G.fast.,2,1\n",
      "I might just add that we are indeed investing in bringing ultrafast broadband with G.fast, with FTTP.,1,1\n",
      "And we are doing so on a fair bet basis.,2,1\n",
      "We are putting our capital at risk to build that, to bring value.,2,2\n",
      "And getting clarity around what a fair bet constitutes through the WLA is clearly a very important outcome for us because it will inform how we think about prospective investment in ultrafast broadband.,2,1\n",
      "And that applies not just to G.fast, it applies to FTTP.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Q: And how long do you think G.fast stays out of charge control?,1,2\n",
      "Is it 10 years like it was with FTTC?,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, we will seek to get that clarity out of Ofcom because, clearly, the first time we did the fair bet, we left - I think both parties came away with a different understanding of that because we don't feel yet we've had the returns of the fair bet on the FTTC investment, the superfast as yet.,2,1\n",
      "A: And as part of the consultation, we are asking the Ofcom clarify as it were the rules around fair bet, so that we can apply them again and again to subsequent technology deployments.,2,1\n",

      "And then my second question is on the synergies and bringing the two divisions together, if I understand what you said earlier, it sounded like you've actually done a lot of work on the cost side between Consumer and EE already and maybe the opportunity is more on the revenue side going forward.,2,1\n",

      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Firstly, on the brands, we see it as a real strength that we can operate three brands.,1,1\n",
      "And when we look at the consumer research on this, there is - each brand operates in a different segment of the marketplace.,1,1\n",
      "So, we can strengthen it a little bit more to add a little bit more sharpness to the positioning.,1,1\n",
      "But we're very comfortable operating three brands and it allows us, I think, to be able to cover more of the market, what you see when you look at any one brand in our marketplace when it comes to consideration so the percentage of customers who would consider you as a choice.,3,1\n",
      "There's no brand in the market that has more than around 50% consideration.,1,1\n",
      "So, as much as we'd like to think that our brands - and I know other people in the market feel the same way - can cover 100% of the market.,2,1\n",
      "The reality is customers don't see it that way.,1,1\n",

      "So, we're comfortable with that.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the synergies themselves, we had a - we set out when we acquired EE - a four-year strategy to realize both cost synergies and revenue synergies.,1,1\n",
      "We reported in Q4 the first year performance and the number was 150 million versus an original target of 100 million.,1,1\n",
      "So, we're well on track; in fact, we're beating the first year.,1,1\n",
      "And we remain confident of delivering the number of 400 million, which is the running rate synergy for costs in year four.,2,1\n",
      "And we always saw that the combined Consumer units will contribute towards that.,1,1\n",
      "So, there are cost synergies that will come from this.,1,1\n",

      "A: In terms of the warranties, these warranties only existed for Orange and DT because they were part of the transaction in the first place.,1,1\n",
      "So, there's nobody else who has these warranties so it shouldn't trigger anything else with respect to the transaction.,3,1\n",

      "Simon is going to...,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean I'm happy to take that and I think the case for investment in FTTP, we clearly need to see a price that is acceptable to the market and drives take-up the market that provides us with a fair return on our investment.,2,1\n",
      "We start there.,1,1\n",
      "In our case, some of that return come through the pricing up from a superfast product, for example, to an ultrafast product, but some of the return comes from people trading from an ADSL product up to a FTT product.,1,1\n",
      "And that, clearly, if you have the reduction in the basic GEA product, if the fiber ultrafast product follows that down, that preserves the investment on those that are trading up from one fiber to another but it crushes the return on those joining from ADSL to a fiber product and that will therefore impact returns.,1,1\n",
      "And we've made this point clearly.,1,1\n",
      "And that issue is amplified for pure fiber players, for example, so new investment, new infrastructure providers.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think a point we've made consistently is that lowering the price of the GEA product will act as a deterrent to and disincentive to investment in fiber.,1,2\n",

      "Just a question on the Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "If my mathematics are right, you made a contribution of 5 million by bringing forward that recognition.,1,1\n",
      "That implies a margin of about 8%.,1,1\n",
      "Is that what we think is a sustainable margin for that, or is it - it's just a pure one-off?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, what we said in the Global Services, the really important thing is overall cash numbers.,1,1\n",
      "I think the days of giving EBITDA margin for Global Services is something that we are well past.,1,1\n",
      "So it's that particular milestone.,1,1\n",
      "That was a particular margin we recognized on, I wouldn't make a big thing about one way or the other.,1,1\n",

      "I was just going to say that one piece of milestone.,1,1\n",
      "The numbers are approximate, but one milestone, extrapolating your margin based on one milestone is a dangerous number to make.,1,2\n",
      "You look and see where Global Services margins are already at, they're higher than that margin on that particular piece of milestone activity.,1,1\n",

      "You seem to have had some good success with large corporate customers in both the U.K.,3,1\n",
      "and Ireland, is that market share driven, or are you seeing companies finally, after delaying projects, finally get going on them?,1,1\n",
      "And it's certainly related, you also mentioned the lower IT and hardware equipment sales at the SMEs.,1,1\n",
      "Could people be considering not spending their own stuff and moving out to the cloud, or is it just a case of hard times?,1,1\n",
      "A: I think in the second one, I think it's a case of hard times.,1,1\n",
      "I don't think we can - one can put this down to the cloud as much as - because you still need a lot of the hardware for the cloud.,1,1\n",

      "We did talk about earlier, we have added the sales resources to our U.K.,1,1\n",
      "base.,1,1\n",
      "We're seeing smaller deals, so therefore you have to respond to that, so we have added there.,1,1\n",

      "One question on the cost base, I know your costs are still coming down, it looks like the rate of reduction has slowed slightly this quarter.,2,1\n",
      "I was wondering should we read anything specific into that?,1,1\n",
      "Is that you're finding it a little bit harder to reduce costs, or are you reinvesting some of the cost savings you've been making in reinvigorating topline growth?,1,1\n",

      "But Tony?,1,1\n",
      "A: The quarter is distorted with the impacts of FX plus the costs associated with the milestone payment.,1,2\n",
      "But costs again bounce up and down quarter-by-quarter.,1,1\n",
      "We've taken out, on a like-for-like basis, we take out the impacts of FX but you take out the impact of milestone payments.,2,1\n",
      "We've done 500 million or so in the first half of the year.,1,1\n",
      "287 million in Q1, 213 million in Q2.,1,1\n",

      "Maurice Patrick from Barclays.,1,1\n",
      "On Wholesale, could you help us to understand, of the change in product mix, how much of the lower EBITDA is or the higher OpEx is a structural product mix?,1,1\n",
      "A: Say again, sir.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Of the higher OpEx within the new products inside wholesale, how much is the structural margin element on a higher cost, and how much is the temporary migration elements of it, so we can understand this sort of format ?,1,1\n",
      "A: It's still going to be a split but certainly, that is not unusual with new products.,1,1\n",
      "There is - new products tend to start at a lower margin that takes a while, both their cost come down over time and you sell more of them.,1,1\n",
      "I think it's almost one of the things in our business.,1,1\n",

      "A: No, I think you've covered it.,1,1\n",
      "What I would say is that the cost base is impacted by the migration cost we highlighted in Q1, and that will continue during the course of this year.,1,1\n",
      "What we should start to see is the stabilization during the course of next financial.,1,2\n",
      "A: Yes?,1,1\n",

      "This is Chris Alliott from RBS.,1,1\n",
      "Couple of quick questions on the fibre again.,1,1\n",
      "In the assumptions in terms of bringing it forward to one year, have you - are there any sort of material expectations for the sort of government and - or are you funding within that?,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, I wonder whether all of the sort of - you've kept it within the CapEx envelope, has that actually been retained within the Openreach CapEx envelope, so you've been able to find the cost savings on CapEx or this CapEx savings within Openreach to be able to do that, or is that some sort of shifting around within the group?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: I think you can assume that in our overall CapEx envelope, we have some continuously for further investment just generally.,1,1\n",
      "And we also become more efficient.,1,1\n",
      "So I think that's how we're able to do it within our overall CapEx envelope.,1,1\n",
      "We can accelerate it because we do try and put aside money for further investment because we see opportunities we like to go after.,2,1\n",
      "And when we give you an overall number around - bear in mind it's around 2.6 billion that was incorporated within that.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of government money, well no, actually, this two-thirds is going to be very largely - we're just doing on our own.,1,1\n",
      "There is some, and I mentioned Northern Ireland examples where we've got funding to support, also in Cornwall we're rolling out very quickly as well.,2,1\n",
      "And there will be a few places, but the vast, vast majority of the delivery is actually going to be our own commercial program.,1,1\n",
      "Bear in mind, we said that two-thirds will be done with their own commercial program and we could do that without any funding at all.,1,1\n",
      "So it's basically executing that program and executing it more quickly.,1,1\n",

      "So could you talk a little bit about the life cycle of the order book and whether the reduction of the order book means we should expect low revenue growth going forward?,1,2\n",

      "A: That's a nice try.,3,1\n",
      "A: Yes, I think I'd like to answer last question.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of Global Services, there is - the contracts are a bit shorter in terms of duration, but this movement towards new names rather than re-signs actually means that you don't have the - you can attach it for a given slightly lower order book, you still have the same positive revenue effects.,3,1\n",
      "And it will happen this year and next year, so we really have very few renewals coming through.,1,1\n",
      "But, Jeff, I don't - you want to say anything else about in terms of shaping the extra order book?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "So Ian said earlier they are smaller, and I like to say we changed the mix in the sales teams.,2,1\n",
      "But we're also tracking improvements in net incremental revenues, and he said it earlier, 50% this year versus last.,2,1\n",
      "I think we did a reasonably good job of getting many of our renewals out of the way and extend the deal horizons and, as many of know, when we sign those renewals, typically you're giving forward price concessions to get that done.,3,1\n",
      "And so it's nice not to have that barrier as well.,3,2\n",
      "So it's all going to blend, but as he said, it's nice to see new customers coming in because it net adds to what you currently have.,3,1\n",
      "And then in our vertical structures, we're seeing some nice growth on our existing customers as well.,2,1\n",
      "Q: So there's no really cross then from the order books of revenues that we can use, given the information you give us?,1,3\n",
      "A: What I'm trying to do is just - is blend that order book both in renewals and get our best mix.,2,1\n",
      "I'd say the only thing that I would cite is your win rates on brand new are different than, obviously, your renewals, and so we continue to look at that.,1,1\n",
      "But it's lumpy, 640 million last year in DFTS kind of distorts the Q2 number this year, so it will continue to be lumpy.,2,2\n",
      "And we're seeing some deals slide.,1,1\n",
      "I have had a few deals, it's moved out two quarters.,1,1\n",
      "They're going to close, it's just when they close.,1,1\n",

      "If you actually have less deals coming through, you will need less.,1,1\n",
      "But Tony, do want to add to that and also the - his attempt to get some more cash numbers?,1,1\n",

      "One point that Jeff alluded to was the fact that the absolute levels of new name revenues that we've won are broadly flat.,1,1\n",
      "So it effectively, what we're saying is, while the order value may have moved downwards, if you look at the level of the new name, what revenues won in absolute terms over the backend of last year -,2,1\n",
      "A: Six months actually, [indiscernible],1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, yes, and it's moved.,1,1\n",
      "So - do you get the point?,1,1\n",
      "The absolute levels of new name is staying fairly flat, which is a good thing.,3,1\n",

      "A: Cash - in terms of the cash numbers, this should give you greater confidence that we'll achieve the outlook we gave you.,3,1\n",
      "Q: So you're going to have a pile of cash at the end of year as a group.,1,1\n",
      "A: In gross cash, yes.,1,2\n",
      "I mean it's something that we have had.,1,1\n",
      "Now I think it's good to be liquid in this uncertain environment because I'm told the occasional banks aren't as good as they might be, but you guys can probably tell me better.,3,1\n",
      "I think it makes a slightly inefficient balance sheet for sure, because what it means is we're earning cash at very low level, and we're paying out until we pay off some of the debt or whatever, but we will have a decent amount of gross cash.,1,3\n",

      "It works both ways, and also just the strength of individual propositions.,1,1\n",
      "But Vision helps sell broadband, broadband helps sell Vision.,1,1\n",
      "I mean there is...,1,1\n",
      "A: What I'd say is there are - there's clearly a market for customers who want buy dual play, and there's clearly a market for people who won't pay - buy triple play, and we've got to be strong in each.,1,1\n",
      "And I think what we're finding is we're just getting better at selling Vision in conjunction with fibre or copper broadband.,2,1\n",
      "So it's a mixture of both.,1,1\n",
      "We've got to be able to compete in both those marketplaces.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Can I just ask one question on costs, follow up to James is, you expect that these efficiency measures that you're pushing through continue to push through in the company, if we strip out the transit costs should we expect underlying OpEx to continue to fall over the next two to three years?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "A: Ultimately depends on the revenue number, but yes, you'll see underlying - the cost base, we're increasing efficiencies.,1,1\n",

      "In other words, are they satisfied with the tweaked up, souped up fibre-to-the-curb proposition that just about gets the number, or do they want actually to incentivize you to put in a lot more CapEx with a more thorough-going FTTP deployment?,2,1\n",
      "A: My talk to Ofcom, actually, don't read it as an issue.,1,1\n",
      "Ofcom are pretty customer focused, and what they want is availability to people and see what the customer does.,3,1\n",

      "This plan is because we think we can make money from it because, actually, we're trying to go to what customers want and look like we are prepared to pay for it.,2,1\n",
      "And if customers suddenly want to pay a lot extra for 100 megabits per second or 300 megabits per second, then we'll provide that service.,1,1\n",

      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "Okay.,1,1\n",
      "So, yes, you're right, we've had commented right at the start when we launched GEA regarding what people would need to make it more industrialized.,1,1\n",
      "And as you'd expect with any product launch, you just can't physically do everything on day one.,1,1\n",
      "So you've got to write down a list of all the product suites you'd like, and you've got to work with your customers.,2,1\n",

      "At the same time, we've made improvements.,2,1\n",
      "But I think - and you should ask them how they feel about it - but I think they would say they think it's a good reasonable fit-for-purpose product.,3,1\n",
      "They would continuously like to see changes during the course of time.,2,1\n",
      "And some of the things that they've talked about doing is part of the self install, and we've kind of said we're looking forward to working with them on that.,2,1\n",

      "To be honest, and I've said this before, it's up to these guys as to who wants to do it.,1,1\n",
      "We win either way.,1,1\n",
      "If they win, answering the question there, we get the stronger revenues through.,1,1\n",
      "If they don't come in, we win because actually our retail market share, I think reflects the fact that we're offering a product that they can't meet.,1,1\n",
      "It's their choice.,1,1\n",
      "I think - and TalkTalk have said that they're - certainly said to us - that they're happy with the way the product sits just now.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of rentals, the - actually, all of the increase in Openreach's revenue was rentals.,1,1\n",
      "But of course there's a chunk of ongoing connection cost, which can go up or it can go down, but last quarter actually, it was slightly down not up year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "So effectively, it's over 100%.,1,1\n",
      "I can't guarantee that connections will not - the whole market's trying as a whole, it could certainly come down.,1,1\n",

      "We've got a transition center where we, for instance, retrain and redeploy literally thousands of staff, which is really good because our once we got our leavers' costs this quarter, it's quite a bit high than this time last year and it has been a source of the increased cost.,4,1\n",

      "So that will change the dynamic.,2,1\n",
      "The - effectively, the removal of staff you see through the leaver payments, the key point on there is that the leaver payments might be up, but part of it is because GS leaver payments last year were included in the restructuring cost.,1,1\n",
      "That explains part of the dynamic associated with that.,2,1\n",
      "And I think the last point to highlight is that the labor cost - the direct labor cost, because we're bringing jobs back in the company, we're also trying to get - improve the focus of how we do the work and that will mean that, in some instances, there's further activities brought back into the company that were inside indirect labor cost, but now in direct labor cost.,2,1\n",

      "A: Just a couple of thoughts.,1,1\n",
      "I think - and the key point Gavin made is right.,1,1\n",
      "So there's - if the competition are doing free broadband, it impacts Sky Worth , or Sky Sports customers.,1,1\n",
      "There isn't very much further they can go in fact actually.,1,1\n",
      "And during the quarter, in fact, we saw some surprising tactics from Sky.,1,1\n",

      "For TalkTalk, in particular, their price for broadband is 2.49 at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "That's been the case for a while.,1,1\n",
      "I was going back through my files from a few years ago a couple of days ago; I saw TalkTalk's sort of best deal in 2007 was free broadband forever.,2,1\n",
      "And forever turned out not to be for very long.,1,1\n",
      "But this market stays very competitive, and that hasn't really changed.,1,1\n",

      "I mean, I say disappointed, it was around about the same amount we did last quarter.,1,3\n",
      "On Sport, we always said, fundamentally, it was about driving broadband first than fibre.,1,1\n",
      "So the free BT Sport is available for all broadband customers.,1,1\n",
      "We've chosen the quarter to focus our outbound telemarketing resource or telesales resource on taking incoming calls on BT Sport.,1,1\n",
      "Normally, much of the upgrade process on fibre is done through outbound calling, and you can see that in some of other metrics I mentioned earlier.,1,1\n",
      "So for example, if you look at the mix in those fibre adds of new to BT - completely new to BT, it increased significantly in the quarter.,1,1\n",

      "A: Well, let me answer the question on mobile.,1,1\n",
      "And then I'll turn over to John to talk about the impact on KPIs on TV.,1,1\n",
      "On mobile and mobility in general, we see that as a really exciting opportunity for us.,4,1\n",
      "Certainly, with 4G in fibre, we're increasingly seeing the markets come together.,1,1\n",
      "And potentially, they'll completely merge, I think, when 4G and fibre really take off.,1,1\n",
      "And I think we're really well placed to benefit from it.,1,1\n",
      "Everybody wants to talk about what we're going to do in the consumer and business market, but it is worth noting that actually helping the MNOs rollout 4G is a great business opportunity in the Wholesale business as well.,3,1\n",
      "Nigel's getting busy signing contracts in that area.,1,1\n",
      "And it also offers small cell opportunities for us in that wholesale market as well.,1,1\n",

      "If you combine Wi-Fi, if you combine 4G, if you combine the MVNO deal with what we've done with EE.,1,1\n",
      "So we're not going to tell you what we're going to do.,1,1\n",
      "But one of the things we've benefited from, I think, in the last 12 months is keeping our powder dry and taking the market by surprise.,1,1\n",
      "And we will try to do the same on this.,1,1\n",
      "But you should expect some news from us in the New Year; well, let me say 2014.,1,1\n",

      "So that was quite encouraging.,2,1\n",
      "There was this spike created in it by BT Sport, and plus also the fact of the launch of pay channels on YouView; sort of a new proposition out there in the quarters' spike of interest.,2,1\n",
      "It's worth qualifying the results by saying that in terms of our focus in the quarter and speaking to Sky customers, our call center agents were actually briefed not to sell against Sky TV, because crucially, the way the switch in prices has worked, the - and Sky get a save opportunity if you switch the TV, and they don't get a save opportunity if you switch the broadband.,2,1\n",
      "So - and that says therefore that there is a - quite a big base of customers that have switched their broadband and not switched their TV.,1,1\n",
      "And there's a future opportunity for us to sell into.,1,1\n",
      "Having said that, we're surely not complacent, and there's clearly more to do to improve the TV proposition as what you've seen today.,2,1\n",

      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Q: I take the point it's an added value, but I guess, when you look at line rental, it's a price that everyone seems to put up roughly the same amount every year, despite the input costs going down.,2,2\n",
      "And when you think about what's going with energy companies at the moment, they're rising wholesale costs, and a political sort of intervention on that is happening at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "Is that something that worries you at all?,1,4\n",
      "How much further do you think you've got to go on line rental?,1,1\n",

      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, first of all, on pricing and value for money in telecoms; yeah, what I note, looking at ONS data, Office of National Statistics, is that the prices in telecoms have come down by 5% since 2007.,2,1\n",
      "And that contrasts obviously with increases in any of the energy companies, any of the water sectors, et cetera.,1,1\n",
      "So I don't think you can compare them.,1,1\n",
      "This is a very, very competitive market.,1,1\n",

      "Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "We always get the headlines when prices go up.,1,1\n",
      "We put our line rental up from January 2014 by 3.5%.,1,1\n",
      "Others have put it up a lot more.,1,1\n",
      "But it's also worth noting, many of our prices came down in the last 12 months.,1,1\n",
      "So when we launched BT Sport, we announced our leading fibre price coming down to 15, and our leading copper price down to 10.,1,1\n",
      "So it's - there are puts and takes here, and I'm confident that - actually, because the market is so competitive and so dynamic, and you can see independently that the prices have come down over time, I'm confident that government and others will see that.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of switching, John, do you want to add some comments on the fairness of switching in this marketplace?,1,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "Just a word on the pricing too; on the line rental price, if I may first, actually?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "A: The pricing change that takes effect from the 1st of January that we've announced is 3.5% on line rental, and that compares versus Sky's figure from the 1st of December of 6%.,1,1\n",
      "And Virgin Media increased their price per line rental by about 8% at the start of the year.,1,1\n",
      "So in that context, our price increases look quite conservative.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of switching; and the outcome of the Ofcom consultation is to unchange the switching processes and letting - getting provider-led.,1,1\n",
      "The positive in that is it's going to create a better customer experience.,3,1\n",
      "The more traction we make in the taking back of broadband market share, that's clearly a good thing for us, qualified by the fact that the cable's still outside the regime.,3,1\n",
      "And that feels like a missed opportunity for customers actually, and for the market and for fair competition, and so is pay TV.,2,2\n",
      "And so on the DCMS strategy paper that came out in July, I think it's going to be good for the market actually, because it talks very heavily in terms of triple-play switching and a combined triple-play process.,3,1\n",
      "And that will be a good thing, I think for us, and for the market as a whole.,3,1\n",
      "Q: So it's something you see happening in the next 12 months [inaudible] (01:04:53 - 01:04:56),1,1\n",
      "A: One couldn't put a timescale against regulatory changes of this sort, because to get this far on the switching process, with the latest announcement, it has taken several years, in fact, actually.,1,1\n",
      "So I'm not going to put a timescale against it.,1,1\n",
      "I think the results show that in the context of the current regime, once you're doing very well, the key thing that we're trying to do; and that's take back broadband market share gain to 93% in the quarter.,1,1\n",

      "We've never said that it's capped or it's going to drop off.,1,2\n",
      "So, it gives us an envelope in terms of what we need to do.,1,1\n",
      "If we need to flex that envelope upwards, we can do that and maintain it still within our overall capital envelope.,1,1\n",
      "Q: So the 300 million or 400 million could be redeployed?,1,1\n",
      "A: We have that scope.,1,1\n",
      "Q: But would you go beyond that scope, if necessary?,1,1\n",

      "They're still trying to manage a cohort of existing customers and acquire new customers too.,1,1\n",
      "And they are faced with the issue that the more they advertise these offers above the line, the more, in effect, they've put their existing revenues at risk too.,1,2\n",

      "So, if the cost of providing services is coming down, but Consumer ARPU continues to go up, then it means the profitability in the Consumer business is clearly going up, as shown by your results.,2,1\n",
      "But doesn't that also mean that the risk, longer term, for further price deflation is increasing, because the cost of providing services is, by definition, coming down and, therefore, you're over-indexing in your Consumer business currently?,1,2\n",

      "A: Yeah, I think when you look to the way we are growing in the market there, I think that there are two basic things; one is an increase in the penetration we have in customers from a wider range of services, which you include the conferencing services, the Cloud Contact services, services that our customers are buying more from us than before, and we consolidated the network.,1,1\n",
      "The second thing is that, in most of those customers, they're saying well, you take over all the services that I have internally, and you run everything for me.,1,1\n",
      "This is what is happening; that movement of people.,1,1\n",
      "That is better for us, because it gives us more sustainability of the business and less volatility, as in the first question we worked.,2,2\n",
      "And we are winning this kind of customers in different geographies as we have shown.,2,1\n",
      "Both in the UK we have won Walgreens Boots Alliance, which is a very major deal; we have been able to secure, Alstom in France; Ulrika in EMEA; Caixa in Brazil.,2,1\n",

      "A: Paul, I think we've been clear in the presentation today that we've reiterated the progressive dividend policy.,3,1\n",

      "We've reiterated our guidance at the same time.,1,1\n",

      "In terms of the uses of cash, it is a balance ultimately.,1,1\n",
      "We need to make sure that we invest in value-creating infrastructure investments in particular and then ensure that the pension is fully paid and supported that we're able to pay down our debt over time.,2,1\n",

      "It's Jerry Dellis from Jefferies.,1,1\n",
      "Just a question on FTTP and then on sports rights please.,3,1\n",
      "On FTTP, if Ofcom were to adhere to the draft WLA proposals, which obviously quite harsh, would there be scope for Openreach to enter into a negotiation with the regulator next year around a fair bet framework for faster full fibre deployment.,2,2\n",
      "And then the question on sports rights really, within the consumer activity, how important do you believe the Premier League rights that you have are today to the maintaining loyalty of your customers and your ability to raise prices.,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: On FTTP, the case for FTTP is a challenging one.,1,1\n",
      "I think you all know that.,1,1\n",
      "It's a long-term payback and it needs a number of conditions to be true for it to be a good use of capital I think.,3,1\n",
      "That includes ensuring that there's a regulatory framework that encourages investment.,2,1\n",
      "And critical to that is ensuring that the GEA price is not depressed in a way that makes the overall absolute returns that you can get through FTTP unattractive.,1,3\n",

      "So there was a piece in, I think it was The Telegraph that around a letter that Karen Bradley had written to Ofcom indicating it was important from a government policy perspective to ensure that there was enough, there was enough in the business case for FTTP and the connection with FTTC and GEA was made very clearly in that.,1,1\n",
      "So it's an ongoing discussion.,1,1\n",
      "We feel Ofcom are listening to our -- the points we're making.,1,1\n",
      "And we need to find a way of making sure we make a fair return.,2,1\n",
      "It's not just the only issue or the only condition that needs to be true of course.,2,1\n",
      "The one I mentioned in my presentation around switchover from copper to fibre is critical as well.,1,2\n",
      "And we need widespread support from CPs to make that switchover.,2,1\n",

      "Look in order to embark on a really largescale fibre-to-the-premise deployment, we are going to need the support of CPs.,2,1\n",

      "Right now we are obliged to put in battery backup.,1,1\n",
      "That is not a very useful thing, but it adds to our cost base.,3,1\n",
      "So we would -- we are right now dialoging to understand how we can eliminate that cost.,1,2\n",
      "And we need assistance from government.,1,1\n",
      "So central and local government, for example, to reduce the cost and complexity and the delays associated with street works and traffic management and the basic physicals of deployment in the streets across the UK.,1,1\n",
      "So we need to collaborate with CPs, with government and with Ofcom because it's clear from the consultation that everybody wants this to go ahead.,1,1\n",
      "But we have to do it in a way that makes economic sense.,1,1\n",

      "The Premier League rights are important, I am not going to deny that.,1,2\n",
      "And we will undoubtedly play a role in the auction when we see the ITT, which should be coming out in the next few months.,1,1\n",
      "But we will remain very disciplined.,1,1\n",
      "Ultimately, we know what it's worth to us, but we're not going to lose our heads on it and we're prepared for a scenario if somebody is prepared to take us or anybody else on in, in the auction then we do know what we would do.,1,2\n",
      "So, I know, Marc recently obviously taken on the combined role across BT Consumer and he -- might be worth you just mentioning your end perspective on this.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I'd echo a lot -- everything you say there, Gavin, I mean there is no doubt in a slowing broadband market our focus is going to be on increasing RGUs per subscriber, that's going to be a really important strategy for us working with the customer base we have and content is a way to differentiate your offering as a network provider and we can see that our customers are enjoying the product.,3,2\n",
      "Our viewing is up pretty significantly year-on-year because of the English teams in the Champions League.,3,1\n",

      "One of your competitors suggested that the summary was a little on the brutal side and I wondered if you could give us any more colour around particularly around the mandatory cutover and what feedback you got --,1,3\n",

      "That's what I mean.,1,1\n",
      "Left out the nuance shall we say.,1,1\n",

      "It might be better -- Clive, do you want to just give a bit more colour on it given it's your conversation.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, I apologize if it was straightforward and punchy, that was actually my intent.,1,2\n",
      "We're very serious about wanting to build this big fibre platform.,1,3\n",
      "And we're going to have to be very straight with all parties, with government, with regulator, and with CPs about what it's going to take to create an environment where that is sensible to build, right.,1,1\n",
      "So in a sense, it's not about being nuance, it's about being dead straightforward.,1,3\n",
      "It is very clear to me that we need a switchover arrangement.,1,1\n",
      "So an arrangement where once we've built the infrastructure in an area then within a certain timeframe the customers on today's Openreach platform move to the new fibre platform.,1,1\n",
      "And that way you socialize the cost as it were of -- of that very large scale investment over a big base.,1,1\n",
      "Everyone gets the benefit because they're now on a platform that is more reliable, its speeds are not only higher, but more consistent, exhibits lower latency.,2,1\n",
      "We expect the CPs to benefits because they will have a lower cost of ownership for their customers because of the reliability and consistency of the platform.,1,1\n",
      "End customers will benefit because they will be able to move up to speed tiers at very high levels.,1,1\n",
      "They will be able to work with their CPs to buy applications the like of which can now be supported over very high bandwidth services.,2,1\n",

      "And I'm not expecting any significant change in the short-term, but we'll update you more in the New Year on distribution.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "A: And on FTTP, generally EU framework has been I think mildly positive for infrastructure providers over the last 10 years.,3,1\n",
      "And provides, I think a good oversight that gets a better balance between investment and competition in many ways.,3,2\n",
      "The cycle of market reviews however, every three years is, in my view is crazy.,1,2\n",
      "And given that we're talking 15-20 year paybacks on some of these investments to have to continue to look at market definitions and have this uncertainty around regulatory pricing on a three-year cycle is not ideal.,1,1\n",
      "And it doesn't make it -- it's not always conducive to creating the conditions for new investments like FTTP because the markets are not always formed and you've got to be able to make the investments upfront before you can get to the -- to the returns.,2,1\n",
      "So look -- it isn't I think a finely balanced argument that we -- we're better with regulation in or out.,2,2\n",
      "As I say to date, it is I think been a net positive.,3,1\n",
      "We get access to the 28 markets data flows move seamlessly.,2,1\n",
      "The standard regulation between all the markets, that's I think always been a net positive to us.,3,1\n",
      "But if there was a way to move into a longer time frame for market reviews that gave us some -- some more certainty around pricing that frankly underpinned the fair bet when we're putting private capital, our shareholders' capital at risk that we are going to get a return.,2,2\n",
      "And maybe we look at different regulatory models going forwards.,1,1\n",
      "But I think that's all for the future, and I don't think we can wait on FTTP that long.,1,1\n",
      "The challenge with the FTTP debate is it's a 25-year project less.,1,2\n",

      "And we're going to need to do some every year, it's more a question of how fast we start and how early we start.,1,1\n",
      "And most importantly, how do we make a return on it.,1,1\n",
      "And do so in a way that's fair to all stakeholders.,2,1\n",
      "Q: (inaudible),1,1\n",
      "A: I would say I'm hopeful.,2,1\n",
      "But it's -- I think the consultation, I was pleased with the conclusions out of the consultation from the BT Group perspective because I think it demonstrated that there is a couple of things, one is, there is a belief that across the industry that we need to do this at some point and it will need -- they'll need to be trade-offs and sacrifices made by everybody, but once we've been through this transition, we will have the best network, one of the best networks across the world.,3,1\n",
      "They recognize it's going to take a long time, they recognize they're going to have to do switchover, they recognize that prices will have to go up to pay for it, and we can't ultimately keep doing this in an environment where the price of broadband comes down, it just it doesn't make sense.,1,1\n",

      "Do you want to add anything?,1,1\n",
      "A: No, I think you quote it, I mean I think the question of three year sequential reviews of different products creates issues around predictability at crisis, use of how different costs are allocated, Gavin has addressed that.,1,3\n",
      "I think the other issue if I may, is that -- and I think, perhaps what you're getting to in terms of switchover it requires slightly to -- it requires a different model because of this, as Clive described one formulation for doing this is that everybody connected pay some sort of additional price.,1,1\n",
      "And that tests the current form of regulation.,1,1\n",
      "We are encouraged that in the consultation to date that is recognized, we're engaging the CPs, regulator, all parties to see if there is a solution to that.,2,1\n",
      "Everybody wants to see this investment move forward.,1,1\n",

      "(inaudible) able to get the idea that prices might move up, but surely has a huge incremental gross margin here for year as well as your maintenance cost come down, if you can cut out copper and CPs?,1,2\n",
      "A: Clive do you want to --,1,1\n",
      "A: The full rate on fibre is considerably lower than the full rate on a couple network.,1,1\n",

      "Those are an effect co-investment because the long term contract has to get supported by credit and balance sheet on the counterparty.,2,1\n",
      "But it is more straightforward in terms of thinking about the ownership and the account of the asset.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of your question on the pension fund, we are as we've explained considering various arrangements through which the BT pension scheme may have claim on BT assets is part of the contribution to address the deficit.,1,2\n",
      "The foundation of that previous existing assets that are measurable and identifiable.,1,1\n",
      "There is then a separate debate about if assets are added, do those go into that structure, how could they get treated.,1,1\n",
      "So there's quite a lot of options and flexibility around how that could get it right, get organized in a world in which there might be some co-investment in certain parts of the network in the future.,1,1\n",
      "A: Pretty good.,3,1\n",
      "Michael.,1,1\n",
      "And then we'll move behind you.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, just two quick questions.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly moving to global services.,1,1\n",
      "I think the new strategy is very clear.,1,1\n",
      "So I was just wondering how long you think it will take to feed through to results.,1,1\n",
      "And by that I mean, two things, firstly how big is the potential run-off of revenues here that you touched on?,1,1\n",
      "And secondly, how long does it take to re-shift the priority away from the smaller single country customers to the bigger customers?,1,1\n",
      "And then just quick follow-up on the dividend policy wording.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, should we read anything into the fact that you've effectively said the interim policy for FY '19 will be 30% of FY '18.,1,1\n",
      "And should we think that potentially gives you the flexibility to announce a dividend policy for FY '19 in May '19 as opposed to coming to the market in FY '18 and saying, this is all forward looking dividend policy like you've done historically.,2,1\n",
      "A: So I can answer that.,1,1\n",
      "No, you should not interpret anything for that.,1,1\n",
      "A: -- of a forward looking dividend policy?,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, let's be clear, we will -- the Board will take its decision over the full year dividend with the full year results were in the context of the latest business plan, the guidance for the year ahead and so forth.,1,1\n",
      "And it will take that decision for the full year and it will continue to have its progressive dividend policy.,3,1\n",
      "So it will be -- but it will be announcing a dividend as we do today for the year and a final dividend.,1,1\n",
      "So I don't think you should interpret any change from that approach.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay, so progressive dividend policy is not just to the end of this year, it's beyond?,3,1\n",
      "A: Our dividend policy is a progressive dividend policy.,3,1\n",
      "That's right.,1,1\n",
      "A: Pretty Good.,1,1\n",
      "And on global services, this -- it isn't an overnight change, we've got to migrate or transform the business over two to three years I would say.,1,1\n",
      "And we've started on the cost base and we've updated you on progress today.,3,1\n",
      "I think there's more to do there ultimately.,1,1\n",
      "We've talked about introducing the new products and services around dynamic network services and the announcements we've made this week on Agile Connect and the relationship with AWS as a step in that direction, but it's still relatively early doors.,2,1\n",
      "And we'll continue to transform the business focus on multinationals.,1,1\n",
      "It means over time, I think some of the local access networks outside of the UK will become less important to us.,1,1\n",
      "But we have no news to update you on that at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "But I know that is relatively new in the job.,1,1\n",
      "Do you want to add a little bit of color from your perspective?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, sure.,1,1\n",
      "Michael, -- where -- there you are.,1,1\n",
      "A couple of things, I think on your question on how long will it take, it will depend a little bit clearly on how the market move in the new areas that we invest in and how well we can utilize the assets where the domestic clients are on at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "I think it will take a while for us to see that through the -- go through the whole system.,1,1\n",
      "I do think as of today we have already implemented a very strong prioritization of our investments into the new areas rather than into the old.,1,1\n",
      "Whilst we continue to focus on utilization of our domestic assets until otherwise.,1,1\n",
      "We invest most of our money today in dynamic network services as well as in our security portfolio going forward.,2,1\n",
      "And those are the two areas that I expect to see traction in the next two years.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Q: Hi, thanks for taking the question, It's Usman from Berenberg.,2,1\n",
      "I've just got two questions please.,3,1\n",
      "The first question was just on the FTTP consultation.,1,1\n",
      "Obviously you mentioned there's broad service provider support for it, is that support conditional on the WLA charge control proposed by Ofcom staying in place or is it just irrespective of what happens to that (inaudible) interesting in that.,2,2\n",
      "The second question -- sorry the second question was just on Global Services, this move to software defined wide area networks, I mean, it's being written upon as kind of deflationary, but from a top line perspective, but it will be interesting to hear what kind of return on investment this kind of new business model yields relative to the old one?,2,2\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: So Clive on FTTP.,1,1\n",
      "(inaudible) on SDN.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, so through the consultation, it was very clear that the CPs acknowledge that they would love their customers' over time to move to a more reliable, more consistent platform that can offer higher speeds and support a wider range of applications.,2,1\n",
      "That's what they were saying to us.,1,1\n",
      "They didn't link in their responses in any tangible way, those statements, those points of feedback to what might be happening in the WLA.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I think software defined networks clearly have a different financial profile than our current MPLS offering simply because it uses less of our own assets and more of partner's assets.,1,1\n",
      "I also think so that will have an impact on the top line.,1,1\n",
      "The margin we make is not so much on the resale of the infrastructure itself, the margin we make is on the services on the top clearly.,1,1\n",
      "So the one who actually can implement, managing end-to-end availability of the software across the networks that's where the value sits and that's where the margin sits.,2,1\n",
      "And we have models that predict how much margin that will give us, but first we're very much focused on becoming the best at it on a global scale and then I think that's where we'll find our upside.,2,1\n",
      "And not so much in revenue, more in the margin across the management of the service itself.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Polo?,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, hi it's Polo Tang from UBS.,1,1\n",
      "I just have two questions.,1,1\n",
      "The first one is on Openreach, when you are thinking about the returns from investing in FTTP, do you think it's possible to get a premium for FTTP versus VDSL?,1,1\n",
      "The reason why I am asking the question is, you've got people at CityFibre, they have been very aggressive in terms of wholesale pricing, but also and if you're talking about migrating subscribers very quickly, you reach the new platform, CPs like Sky and TalkTalk are going to need some incentivisation, so how should we think about wholesale pricing for FTTP?,2,4\n",
      "Second question is really about the new Chairman, because I think he's highlighted improved customer service as a priority, so does this imply further costs and more investment on this side?,2,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, do you want to talk about pricing in the first question, the FTTP question, I'll tackle the question on customer service.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, so, look there is something very significant in it the move from a copper platform to a full fiber platform and FTTP platform for the CPs.,1,1\n",
      "They have the opportunity to compete harder in the marketplace because they will be offering services over, you know, a world-class platform.,1,1\n",
      "They will be able to offer higher speeds and associated higher prices.,1,1\n"

      "They will be able to sell other applications that use the higher competence of this fibre network.,1,1\n",
      "And they will save money in their service to their end customers, because there will be fewer faults and a better consistency of service.,2,2\n",
      "So there is plenty in it for the CPs.,1,1\n",
      "And we're dialoging with them through that consultancy process to help them understand all the advantages to them.,1,1\n",
      "That being so, that should allow them to recognize that a higher wholesale price is justified in terms of their own economics.,1,1\n",
      "And it's that kind of discussion and debate that we had during this phase of the consultation.,2,1\n",
      "Q: So just to clarify we have recognized that, well, they have acknowledge that they are willing to pay a premium in terms of all the feedback that you've had, is that the broad thrust?,1,1\n",
      "A: They understand that we will build this platform, if we can create a business case.,1,1\n",
      "We have been very clear with them that business case will stand if we can achieve a wholesale price increase and a switchover mechanism.,1,1\n",
      "There are few other things that we have to do, but those are two core things.,1,1\n",
      "And we've been very clear, very open, very transparent about the need for those two things.,1,1\n",
      "In the next phase of the consultation pre-Christmas, we will be more specific about what that price premium has to look like and the nature of the switchover that we anticipate and we'll take that reaction on those more specific points.,2,1\n",
      "A: Then on service, Polo, and customer experience in general, the Chairman is a strong supporter of our strategy.,2,1\n",
      "He's been on the Board since June.,1,1\n",
      "He's seen the progress we've been making and you could see it from the slides we were showing earlier over the last 18 months.,3,1\n",
      "And we see -- we got good visibility of that going forward.,3,1\n",
      "And it's -- we are having an impact on both the operating metrics, the RFT metric that we've been using for several years.,1,1\n",
      "But also on net promoter score and using techniques such as Medallia which is a system of getting closed loop feedback into the business direct from customers.,1,1\n",
      "So we're seeing the dial move on all aspects of this moving at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "The investments we're making in service are bearing fruit, you can see that in the fault rate in the Openreach network.,1,2\n",
      "So in spite of usage of that network going up probably 50% year-on-year behind broadband, the underlying fault rate is coming down.,1,4\n",
      "And it is being -- that is reversing a trend that has been going in the opposite direction for several years.,1,1\n",
      "You can see the investments we are making in UK contact centres because we know customers prefer to speak to somebody from the UK.,1,1\n",
      "That costs more.,1,1\n",
      "We've been trailing that through the numbers to you for a number of quarters now, but we're seeing that coming through in customer satisfaction.,2,1\n",
      "You're seeing the investments in digital coming through as people want to serve themselves.,1,1\n",
      "And we're also investing more generally in PTC prevention to call type -- propensity to call type investment, so that people don't have to contact you in the first place.,1,1\n",
      "And then finally, we're also investing a lot more in bandwidth.,1,1\n",
      "So we want to make sure that products themselves are the best available that can be in the form of fixed bandwidth in the fibre market, but it's also 4G coverage and 4G speeds through the EE network.,2,1\n",
      "So there is a lot of investments.,1,1\n",
      "The Chairman is a 100% behind it.,1,1\n",
      "He understands that the future of the business really amongst other things depends on having fantastic customers service and a great customer experience and he strongly endorse that.,3,1\n",
      "A: And the other thing I'd say, Gavin, this is not a quarter-by-quarter.,1,1\n",
      "This is a long-term strategy we have because we know that by improving the experience our customers get, that's going to drive a more sustainable, more valuable revenue stream in the long-term.,2,1\n",
      "It will also actually drive better productivity as well.,2,1\n",
      "If you look at what's happened to right first time, growing up, that means there are fewer things to fix.,1,1\n",
      "And that ultimately will also drive efficiency through the business.,1,1\n",
      "So we've set out on this knowing it's a long-term journey to get ahead and stay ahead of competitors and bring better value to customers.,2,1\n",
      "A: Thanks Polo.,1,1\n",

      "Yes, it's Sunil from Bank of America.,1,1\n",
      "Question actually more for Marc Allera now.,1,1\n",
      "I think Marc, you've been in the roll as head of the combined consumer unit for three months, what are your impressions of what you can sort of do to drive growth in this business going forward clearly in a more challenging consumer environment.,1,1\n",
      "I am interested especially as you've come from the EE side of how you can bring that closer to the BT broadband business and should we see new products bundles, even possibly discounts over the next 6 to 12 months?,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Marc.,1,1\n",
      "A: Hi there.,1,1\n",
      "It's actually only two months, rather than three, so still early days.,1,1\n",
      "But what's clear is the opportunity ahead of us is significant.,1,1\n",
      "We've got three great brands.,3,1\n",
      "We've got a very large customer base.,1,1\n",
      "We've got fantastic people.,3,1\n",
      "We've got fantastic distribution.,3,1\n",
      "And with a fixed and mobile network, the opportunity to bring converged products and services to customers along with our content is also significant.,1,1\n",
      "And there are many households where we only have one relationship with the customer either on the BT brand or the EE brand.,1,1\n",
      "And there are millions of households where we have no relationship at all.,1,1\n",
      "So what my team and I are working on at the moment and as I said before, we'll be able to come out and explain our plans in the New Year to all of you.,1,1\n",
      "We're working on our plan to make the most of the brands and the market opportunity we have which is significant.,1,1\n",
      "And part of that will be converged bundles and offers as you say brought together for customers.,1,1\n",
      "I am less excited about discounts, I am more excited about more for more bringing customers more value, better experiences, a better more joint up network experience, which we can provide along with content to differentiate as well.,3,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "I think Sam and then --,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, morning, guys.,1,1\n",
      "It's Sam from Exane here.,1,1\n",
      "Two questions.,1,1\n",
      "First on content, I think I've heard a couple of times you say you know what the content is worth to your guys.,1,1\n",
      "I think you are spending 700 million to 800 million a year at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "If you look at the direct revenue earn, it kind of pretty much matches one for one, how -- when your shareholders ask you how you're making money on, well, what do you tell them, what is the math that you run through to kind of explain how much money and obviously you don't want to give anything away in terms of auction bidding, so as much as you can give us.,3,1\n",
      "And then on the pension that kind of Section C members in the CPI switch, I guess in 2011 when you did this in Section A and B, you must have investigated it for Section C, why now, what's changed and there are few companies who have made this move and specifically they've not mentioned RPI in their trust deed and rules, what does your trust deed and rules say for Section C members?,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Do you want to talk about the Section C, firstly Section A and B?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, I mean, obviously this is subject to a court hearing.,1,1\n",
      "And therefore, I don't think it's appropriate to say much more than we have looked at the scheme.,1,1\n",
      "We don't believe that RPI is a relevant measure, and we believe that CPI is more so and that will be something that will be examined and ruled up on in early December.,1,1\n",
      "Really not appropriate to say more at this stage.,1,1\n",
      "Q: (inaudible).,1,1\n",
      "A: Sorry, what?,1,1\n",
      "Q: (inaudible),1,1\n",
      "A: The scheme has historically used RPI, that's right.,1,1\n",
      "Yeah, content?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, on content, look the strategy on BT Sport has always been to look at the impact it has of course the business as a whole.,1,1\n",

      "And that's one of the areas you are looking at going forward.,1,1\n",

      "So kind of engaging with your stakeholders, interesting discussions you are having with government, because kind of rising utility bills in general that's been something that's been very collectively sensitive here in the UK.,2,1\n",
      "I mean obviously what you are proposing here effectively is a price increase for consumers if we go with the proposed model.,1,1\n",
      "Just be interested in the kind of government's reaction you are getting to that, are they willing to back that?,2,1\n",
      "I mean in the consultation in July, I think you talked about a GBP7 increase in value per line that you were looking for.,2,1\n",
      "I mean, presumably now you're talking maybe the cost of build could be coming down, there could be some OpEx saving.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, can you help quantify what kind of price increase we might be talking about?,2,1\n",
      "And then the second question is on BT Consumer, I mean, revenue growth that seem to slow quite sharply this quarter from about 7% to 1%, could you help us kind of dig into the underlying trends there, is there anything specific to call out this quarter?,2,1\n",
      "Is that something we can expect to recover in the coming quarters?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "On FTTP, maybe I'll just say a few words and then I'll pass to Clive and then I'll pick up the revenue streams in consumer.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the discussions with government, there is strong desire to go to what they call for fibre networks, what we call FTTP going forward to ensure that the UK stays right at the front of the pack in term of digital infrastructure and in terms of the digital economy in general.,1,1\n",
      "And particularly as we navigate away through Brexit, I see the digital economy is one of the key drivers of economic growth over the medium term.,1,1\n",
      "So they understand that ultimately if you want to build a network like that and you want to build it across the whole of the UK and you want to make it available on a wholesale level, the economics have to support that.,2,1\n",
      "And you can't put that capital at risk if there is long-term decline in wholesale prices.,1,2\n",
      "It just doesn't work.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, in terms of comparing this with the utilities, I don't know whether you've seen the chart that looks at our pricing in our markets versus electricity, water or gas since 1990.,1,1\n",
      "And it demonstrates I think what a great job the UK infrastructure providers have done at driving down costs over the long-term within network and continuing to invest over that time period.,3,1\n",
      "I think it supports the model that has worked, I think significantly because costs have come down -- forget the number, but it is -- it's the sort of 30% to 40% over that period, whereas there's been inflation in everything else.,2,2\n",
      "So we've -- the telecoms market, you've got better products, low unit prices, you know, is fueled, has funded innovation and investment, inflation in other utilities where perhaps they haven't had the same sort of innovation.,2,2\n",
      "So I feel very confident that there is a strong case to make this investment.,3,1\n",
      "People understand that we have to get a return and they will be supportive of it.,2,1\n",
      "But if we don't have that we can't make the case, I mean, it is pretty straightforward like that.,3,1\n",
      "Do you want to just add any color in terms of the dynamics around the GBP7?,2,1\n",
      "A: The conversation with government isn't just about pricing, it's about how they can help us in other ways.,1,1\n",
      "So for example they could help us reduce our cost to build by giving us improved arrangements for (inaudible), the street works, the traffic management et cetera.,2,1\n",
      "That's very significant.,1,1\n",
      "DCMS now has setup a barrier busting team actually which is helping us with those issues and helping to reduce our cost base.,1,2\n",
      "So it's not just about their appetite for price rises, it's about how can they materially help us get our cost points down.,1,1\n",
      "And they've -- DCMS have been very helpful in that regard.,3,1\n",
      "A: In terms of the ARPU movements in consumer, it does move around depending on the timing and the sequencing of pricing changes year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "So we're very confident that the strategy of more for more, driving RGUs per customer, driving dual-play, triple-play, quad-play is the right one for us.,3,1\n",
      "So that's really what explains the sort of quarter-on quarter-change.,1,1\n",
      "I don't know there's anything else -- Okay, John.,1,1\n",

      "They are in trial, those trials are going very well and as part of our review, as we bring the BT Consumer any divisions together, distribution as I said before is going to be a major part of that.,1,1\n",
      "There's no doubt the stores are a big asset, the nationwide, we're growing that store base.,1,2\n",

      "You can see the improving trend on our major and public sector division in terms of revenue.,2,2\n",
      "During that period, we've also been working very hard on our sales capability distribution to really strengthen the organization working very hard in customer experience in line with a lot of the comments you have heard to drive down our cost base.,1,1\n",
      "And where we are in terms of the contracts that we've lost, and we're 18 months into that two period now, from what we've disclosed in previous quarterly results around those revenues there largely 50% of time after that 18 month period.,1,1\n",
      "Our expectation now is that we will retain half of what still remains on those contracts.,1,1\n",
      "And probably around the end of the fiscal year, we will be in a what I would say a steady state contract position in relation to that.,1,1\n",
      "So my expectation as you will see because of that and because of all the other activity that we have put in place a strengthening performance relative to what you see today.,1,1\n",
      "Now, obviously we're not going to disclose what that will be, but certainly our confidence around our sales order position and our cost base et cetera has improved.,2,1\n",
      "And the underlying performance of the business is strong, you can see it from what we disclosed in mobile today with 9% revenue growth year-over-year in Q2, which is a significant improvement on the integration of the businesses with EE business as its come in.,2,1\n",

      "No, I'm not going to put an order of magnitude, we're talking across a sort of wide range of potential solutions for addressing the deficit.,1,2\n",
      "To your second question, closing a scheme doesn't impact deficit, which is obviously a reflection of liabilities accrued to date.,1,3\n",
      "What it impacts is the cost of providing pensions moving forward.,1,1\n",

      "Could you talk a little bit about, I mean, obviously you don't want to talk too much about the contracts I guess, but when do you expect to see material profit from that contract hitting your accounts?,2,2\n",
      "A: You want to take this?,1,1\n",
      "A: I'm not going to do the rapid fire mental arithmetic on the roaming, but clearly it was one headwind on the performance (inaudible) that in my remarks in terms of low tens for the quarter and we've indicated high tens for the full year.,1,2\n",
      "In terms of the ESN contract, where the contractors, as you know is running behind, although we've hit our deadline in -- and the recent milestone in Q2 and we continue to fulfill our part of the contract and continue to make progress on that.,3,1\n",
      "The revenue will build over time as the wider contract is completed.,1,1\n",

      "A: Yeah, we've hit our milestones, continue to do that working very closely with the Home Office and nothing more to add.,1,1\n",
      "A: I mean the one thing I would say is that it's in building the network, the network is also available for consumers and businesses.,1,1\n",
      "And that benefiting from the extra coverage as of today.,1,1\n",
      "So I think the coverage is now 86%, is that right?,1,1\n",
      "A: 86, yeah.,1,1\n",
      "A: Geographic coverage has improved over 20 basis points in the last 18 months.,2,1\n",
      "Q: So, if I were to do some mental arithmetic, the EBITDA effectively grew more than 20% if you stripped out the roaming cost and you've got the investment already made for ESN which is yet to come in and that will be booked in EE.,1,1\n",
      "Is that correct?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, you're correct on the roaming and yes, you're correct that over time there is a directional benefit to come from the extended 4G coverage that ESN provides and some revenue associated specifically with the contract.,1,1\n",
      "And that is ahead of us in the plan.,1,1\n",
      "But it's also fair to say that we are still in the process of building ESN and there would be more assets built into our balance sheet as that project continues.,2,1\n",
      "And the CapEx is showed in the ESN -- in EE, I beg your pardon.,1,2\n",
      "A: And do you want to just mention Apple.,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, I was going to say the only thing I'd also add on the EBITDA I think we talked about it in the results as well.,1,1\n",
      "This has been quite an exceptional period for handset launches, we've actually -- we normally have one Apple launch, we've actually had three.,4,1\n",
      "But we've had the ten that's obviously staggered and is now in this quarter.,1,1\n",
      "So I think we need to certainly at the very least get to the end of next quarter and probably into the final quarter of the year to see the full impact of these new handset launches in the portfolio.,1,1\n",
      "The early signs on the ten are very strong, I do think there'll be some supply constraints there.,1,2\n",
      "So it's going to be relatively volatile on the EBITDA side.,1,2\n",
      "So you need to take a couple of quarters to smoothen out and get a really clear view of where we're going to be.,1,1\n",
      "Q: I want to put 20% in every quarter --,1,1\n",
      "A: I think the other important point to be made, Nick is that, this is a long-term build out, I'd be really clear.,1,1\n",
      "This takes time for the ESN to build up.,1,1\n",
      "We're doing our part, we then have to have the rest of the contract assembled, you've then got to test whether or not bring all of the sites live.,1,1\n",

      "Question on consumer, I mean the ARPU growth was still quite respectable, but the revenues slowed down quite markedly, which have implied volumes decelerated quite a bit.,3,1\n",

      "A: So I think that these are -- well firstly, as we indicated a meaningful component of the trend in EBITDA was associated with the year on effect of Italy.,1,1\n",
      "And there also -- as we also described there were some additional lever and pension costs.,1,1\n",
      "There was however a trading related decline in EBITDA.,1,2\n",
      "We also explained that that's a function of customers coming to the market with smaller contracts typically with a component of SDN within it.,1,1\n",
      "And they tend to be less capital intensive.,1,1\n",

      "But definitely we're more focused on cash than on top line.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay, we're going back to a question from callers in the past, over time this is a less capital intensive business model and over the time that will play out.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Just one quick follow-up on another issue.,1,1\n",
      "With the relationship you now have with 3 UK, which is obviously starting to go little bit (inaudible) arguments in this court case.,1,2\n",

      "And so, we think we're competitive and, of course, we have the BT Infinity offer at around 20 plus net at - is it 16 a month?,1,1\n",
      "So we're sort of hitting both ends of market.,1,2\n",
      "The present one -- we think it's a very, very good value offer on the fibre and I think that's why customers seemed to be taking it up and they seem to really like the service, and as Ofcom's speed test confirmed, getting really very good speeds and that's before we do the upgrade.,4,1\n",

      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Yeah, actually a couple of questions, please, on the UK broadband market.,3,1\n",
      "If you look at your 56% of DSL, LLU and fibre and -- in the quarter, it suggested that the UK markets slowed.,1,1\n",
      "I was just wondering -- is there any reason for this in particular?,1,1\n",
      "When I say slowed, I mean the absolute number year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "Any sort of seasonal impact that's going on there or any changes in the competitive dynamics?,2,1\n",
      "And just as an add-on to that, where do you think broadband penetration can go in the UK ultimately, say, in a four or five-year view?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: It's difficult.,1,2\n",
      "I mean, broadband penetration continues to increase.,1,1\n",
      "It seems to be at the core.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, one worries with the difficult economic times that broadband penetration, actually, growth might stop.,1,4\n",
      "That's not happened.,1,1\n",
      "Ultimately, I would say if you take the longer term, it seems like it's going to be such a core service that you are going to see long-term growth.,2,1\n",
      "It's difficult to call whether you might see some sort of S-curve before it takes off again.,1,2\n",
      "Very, very difficult to call that.,1,3\n",
      "But I think what's actually the solution to the broadband market has been, actually, if anything, the most interesting thing that we've seen roughly on 250,000-odd customer net adds, 1 million per quarter - sorry, 250,000 a quarter, about 1 million per year pretty much quarter after quarter.,3,2\n",
      "So I don't think particularly we see that as slowing down this quarter.,1,1\n",
      "It seemed to be pretty much okay.,3,1\n",
      "And as I said earlier, with more households, one might actually - one expects actually one of the drivers of growth of broadband, but there might be a quarter or a few quarters where it slows down.,1,1\n",
      "We've not seen it yet, but I think I said a year ago and two years ago that and that one day, I suspect that will happen.,1,2\n",
      "But we're still at penetration, whilst it's over 70%, we've still got some way to go, I think, in penetration in the UK.,1,1\n",

      "'And then on the Retail side of your OpEx, minus 7% in the quarter, was that materially impacted by the lower hardware sales?,1,1\n",
      "I.e., you talked about the revenue, but was there a major cost element in that 7% number?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: I'll ask Tony to talk about the EBITDA.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, there were low margin sales but I'll ask Tony to add anything.,1,2\n",
      "In terms of copper additions, I mean, the copper additions, of course, are an Openreach level, rather, so it's difficult to tell.,1,2\n",
      "I mean, you see LLU going up.,1,1\n",
      "To us, we don't really look at it that way in terms of - but you do see the broadband growing and you see the broadband growing faster than you see the copper growing, but the good news is that copper is growing.,3,1\n",
      "But, Liv, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that.,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, we have seen a little bit of second lines coming back.,1,1\n",
      "So I guess during the heart of the recession, we saw people cancel second lines.,1,2\n",
      "We have seen a little bit of that coming back, I guess, during the course of this year, but not enough to move the dial.,1,1\n",
      "So we just don't check it out in the same manner.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I think it's just - I think it's mobile-only households coming back a wee bit, but actually net-net-net, the household creation is tending to flow through into lines.,1,2\n",
      "And actually it's not growing probably quite as fast as household creation, so there's still - if anything, we're creating more headroom, I would think, in the future in that respect.,3,1\n",
      "But, Tony, do you want to talk about cost to EBITDA, et cetera?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, sure.,1,1\n",
      "On the retail side, sure, the reduction in the low margin hardware sales would have had an impact in the cost base.,1,2\n",
      "It would have affected the cost base by a couple of points.,1,1\n",
      "But underlying reduction was - if you look and see, we took 7% of the costs out this quarter, compared with 6%.,1,1\n",

      "On the debt.,1,1\n",
      "I'll ask Tony to say, but I mean, I think exactly what we do on the debt depends on what we do on the pension.,1,1\n",

      "A: Yeah, so, and then on BDUK, BDUK is - there's a number of local authority bids that actually are sort of not quite in BDUK, so you've got Wales and you've got Lancashire, they're sort of related to, but not in the overall framework and they're progressing very well.,3,1\n",
      "And I'll ask Liv to give a couple of comments on it, but just generally, we will bid, I think, pretty in most of, if not all the places.,3,1\n",

      "We think most of those bids will, in terms of process, will run over the course of the next 12 months.,1,1\n",
      "Clearly, they will have different dates.,1,1\n",

      "So that's the kind of order of magnitude of this that you can expect to see come out of BDUK.,2,1\n",
      "Q: Liv, any color on how many lines that 30 bids translates to?,1,1\n",
      "A: Oh, we couldn't tell at the moment, because it totally depends on what each council chooses.,1,1\n",
      "Some are choosing to go for 95% coverage, some want to go for 90%, some 80%, we honestly couldn't tell you until the bids come out.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "So, I mean, we'll go for a very high proportion.,1,1\n",
      "And exactly which areas we decide to cover or not cover remains a little unclear.,1,2\n",
      "A: I mean based on the bids that we've got active at the moment, they tend - the coverage tends to be 90% to 95%.,1,1\n",
      "A: That's true.,2,1\n",
      "A: So I think it will - it's why, I think, we're seeing - we would expect post-BDUK and the other initiatives that the UK will end up getting more than 90% of the UK covered in fibre, that's really both consistent with that number.,1,1\n",
      "And in terms of LTE, I mean, I think I'll have to ask some of the mobile companies.,1,1\n",
      "But LTE, we are certainly working with them and happy to - we've been trialing with Everything Everywhere down in Cornwall.,2,1\n",
      "I mean, in terms of how it relates to BDUK, I think what we would look to do in areas is you do as much fibre as makes sense and then you look at other technologies such as TV white space as to what it can do, and then see what - and what other technologies, such as - including LTE, do they make sense to add.,1,1\n",
      "But we'll also look at the opportunity that maybe some of the rural coverage sub-stays are going to come up might offer.,1,1\n",

      "A: James, I mean, I'm not keen at this point to start giving a forecast for next year.,1,1\n",

      "The environment is more difficult.,1,2\n",
      "There's no question about that, but the trends are improving.,2,1\n",

      "We've got a lot of self-help in our business and I think we're driving - we're pleased to bring forward our EBITDA number and I think that shows our confidence going forward.,3,1\n",

      "The thing is, when you move people to fibre, a few things happen.,1,1\n",
      "One is you do get an uplift; and secondly, you get - so you get an uplift which in terms of people going to higher price bands, so that helps in terms of the mix and that's worth a number of pounds.,1,1\n",

      "In terms of Infinity stats, we certainly see a much better performance in areas where we've got fibre than where we don't and significantly better and so it's a comment we made last time that the net adds in these areas are a lot higher than they are in areas where we don't have fibre.,2,1\n",
      "So it's very encouraging.,3,1\n",
      "And in terms, Gavin, of the proportion that's new, of course, with broadband, you often get completely new customers.,1,1\n",

      "A: Well, about half are new to BT broadband and about 20% are new to BT overall.,1,1\n",

      "Now what you've got to look at is what you believe the long-term numbers are.,1,1\n",
      "And so, it will have an impact.,1,1\n",
      "But the question is, will it have an impact compared to the last time they looked at this, because you've got to take this more on the spot rate and that's absolutely what we were pointing out to them.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the Wi-Fi, I'll ask Gavin to say a few words about it going forward.,1,1\n",
      "I think it's been very interesting in Wi-Fi.,3,1\n",
      "We made a bet a number of years ago on Wi-Fi, and every so often, it helps to - you can be writing, you can be a bit fortunate and I think we've got a bit of both there that we did.,2,1\n",
      "We invested in hubs that could effectively create open Wi-Fi and do it in a very safe and secure way.,3,1\n",
      "And they were more expensive, frankly, than not doing it and it's been a long-term investment.,1,2\n",
      "But it's the reason that we are now looking at 3.5 million Wi-Fi hotspots in the UK, as well as the investment we made in the Openzone division.,1,2\n",
      "And I think one of the reasons we were able to do that and wanted to do that was actually partially because we were able to focus on fixed line and broadband and rather than having a bit of push-me, pull-me with a Mobile division.,1,2\n",
      "And it certainly has helped the UK frankly not have the problems with the mobile network that a number of other countries have had as a result of data.,1,2\n",
      "And it's also given a very good offer to our customer base of taking their broadband out and about.,4,1\n",
      "And we think there is more possibility to drive Wi-Fi further.,1,1\n",
      "But Gavin, do you want to say anything more?,1,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, Wi-Fi continues to be a critical part of our offer to our customers.,1,2\n",
      "We know that the customers that use it have lower churn and get a lot more benefit.,1,1\n",
      "So we'll continue to innovate.,1,1\n",
      "So there will be significant improvements around the customer experience we'll be bringing in, in the next 12 months.,2,1\n",
      "In addition to that, we've got a number of big contracts, particularly in the Retail space, hospitality and of course, the Olympics that we'll be delivering as well.,1,1\n",
      "So, there's a lot happening in Wi-Fi at the moment and we're very much at the forefront of it.,1,1\n",

      "Please go ahead, Guy.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Just a couple of quick questions.,1,1\n",
      "Can we just confirm that there was no payment delays from a BT perspective in the quarter and as a result of that, your working capital should improve as some of your late payers pay in this quarter?,1,1\n",
      "And secondly, just on OTT services, there's been a lot of noise about it recently in the press and I just wondered how BT Vision was going to pit itself against some of these new entrants.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Tony, do you want to answer working capital, given, of course, we've already given our cash flow forecast for the end of this year?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "We made a commitment that we will not delay supplier payments simply to meet quarterly cash flow targets, and that commitment stays.,1,1\n",
      "So we will get - we'll get a kick-in in terms of the debt position, as long as the people who didn't pay in Q3 pay in Q4.,1,2\n",
      "A: And they know who they are.,1,1\n",
      "And the other question was - OTT, yeah.,1,1\n",
      "On OTT, one of the things that I think - OTT services will add to the richness of services, no question about that.,2,1\n",
      "But one of the really important differentiators for our vision is not just the range of content they've got and the fact it is delivered to your TV, and we've spent a lot of time and money actually getting the connection into your TV set.,1,1\n",
      "It's quality-assured.,1,1\n",
      "And that means, for instance, if you take iPlayer, which iPlayer, of course, is an OTT service effectively.,1,1\n",
      "And at iPlayer and BT Vision, there's no buffering.,1,1\n",
      "And the buffering that happens in iPlayer, actually, usually has nothing to do with the access line.,1,1\n",
      "It's to do with the Internet.,1,1\n",
      "The Internet is a best effort service and what Vision offers is not a best effort.,2,1\n",
      "It's offered a guaranteed cause .,1,1\n",
      "And so you get great picture quality and that's why iPlayer has just taken off on BT Vision, because it's on the TV set and there's no buffering.,3,1\n",
      "So we see what we're offering in Vision is effectively a higher-quality service and I think that's the real differentiator we see versus the OTT services.,1,1\n",
      "But OTT, in general terms, will add to the general thing.,1,1\n",
      "Gives another reason for getting broadband and will provide a range of services ranging from quality assured and we'll look at other options.,1,1\n",
      "A: The only thing I'd add, Ian, is we see ourselves as a retailer first and foremost, and particularly with YouView, we see the opportunity for many of these services to provide - to be provided on the YouView platform into people's homes.,1,1\n",
      "So I see them as another reason why they'll choose our offer over our competitors'.,1,1\n",
      "A: And also, another - video is another reason that people like fibre, particularly as they get to the higher speed video.,2,1\n",
      "So I think it's - the more the merrier, frankly, broadband at the heart of people's homes.,2,1\n",

      "Please go ahead.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Hi.,1,1\n",
      "Morning.,1,1\n",
      "There was a question on the fibre-to-the-premise overlay, please.,3,1\n",
      "Just can you give us some idea, I mean, very roughly of the cost to Openreach?,1,3\n",
      "Is it significantly different, because you're mixing in region between fibre-to-the-home and fibre-to the-cabinet than maybe a direct fibre-to-the-home connection might be?,1,1\n",
      "And do you assume it's just going to be ultimately too expensive for the mass market or is your comment about being interesting to SME more to do with the just capacity use you're seeing at the moment?,2,2\n",
      "And then second on Vision.,1,1\n",
      "You've got YouView coming.,1,1\n",
      "We've mentioned it, it's been pretty strong, but could you mention any updates?,3,1\n",
      "Again, you've gotten pre-YouView coming in in the middle of the year.,1,1\n",
      "And is that going to be enough, do you think, to maintain the price premium that Vision has?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, I'll let Gavin talk about Vision in a second, about what we've got planned that he wants to say about it at this point.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the fibre product, basically, this will be a product on demand and it's going to be -- yeah, customers who want it.,1,1\n",
      "Understand, for most customers, the service speeds we'll be offering will be more than enough and that's, I think, why we're saying that actually, we're not sure how much demand we'll actually have.,1,1\n",
      "But there will be some people who - multiple, multiple users and that will tend to be SMEs who will want - there are some other people who would maybe want a private circuit just now, but frankly, private circuits are too expensive.,1,2\n",
      "And - but I think we would recognize there's a capital cost involved there and that will have to be reflected in the pricing structure of it.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think, net to us , we're not expecting a huge increase in cost, but we think it's a really good solution to the quandary of the fact that maybe a small number of people who want fibre to the premise-type speeds, but actually rolling out a whole area can be incredibly expensive.,4,4\n",
      "And it just takes longer and it's far more disruptive to most homes and gardens and things like that and I think it's a really good option for - those who want can have it.,4,2\n",
      "And those who - and the vast majority who will be very happy with the 100 megabits speeds, they don't need to pay for it.,3,1\n",
      "But I think it will be pretty well priced and we'll have the 80 megs coming shortly.,3,1\n",
      "And as I said, the 100 will be something that we'll do vectoring at later stage that we will be delivering.,1,1\n",
      "So no, I think the interest of these how much the fibre-to-the-cabinet speeds have improved, even over the last couple of years and customers are really getting those speeds.,2,1\n",
      "Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks, Nick.,2,1\n",

      "I mean, they do discuss it with the company, they do run the investment policy and they will obviously look to see what the appropriate mix of investments and a combination of fiscal returns so we look at opportunities in infrastructure and places like that but that's very much they run and just talked about that earlier, it's probably not a good idea for a corporate to try and run the investment policy so it's expert investment managers do that.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",

      "And then secondly, on Sports costs with content, can you sort of help us understand a bit about the magnitude of what you thought will start impacting Q4 and Q1 next year?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: In terms of YouView, I think it's too early for ourselves to see, customers seem to really like it and I'm very positive on the YouView box, and we're seeing good take-up.,4,1\n",
      "So as I said, we started advertising this in January.,1,1\n",
      "So I think any extrapolation would be a bad idea at this point.,1,2\n",
      "But, Gavin, do you want to add anything?,1,1\n",
      "A: The only thing I'd add, Maurice, is the early signs are that it's a decent product.,1,1\n",
      "It's a good product.,3,1\n",
      "Customers like it and usage, particularly it's the on demand catch-up compares very well with our existing platforms.,2,1\n",
      "A: And on the cost of Sport in Q4.,1,1\n",
      "Yes, there is cost obviously.,1,1\n",
      "We've got people already doing production but that's something that we will have to try and absorb and overall, it's one of these things and obviously, we don't recognize the rights costs until we start - it'll hit the retail business and the impact of it.,1,1\n",
      "But we - the big costs really start to occur starting in - when we start to amortize the rates costs.,1,1\n",

      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Your next question comes from Simon Weeden of Citigroup.,1,1\n",
      "Please proceed.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you very much.,1,1\n",
      "Yes, I'm pretty much on the same sort of topic.,3,1\n",
      "I just wondered if you could maybe fit in a [indiscernible] .,1,1\n",
      "First, would it be fair to say that since the beginning of January, you've been seeing a pickup in YouView box shipments that you've also seen a pickup in net additions on Vision or are you seeing YouView boxes staying as the BT Vision [indiscernible] customers staying ?,2,1\n",
      "On the subject of set-top boxes, would you be introducing a new unit by set-top box in due course to eliminate the duplication here?,1,2\n",
      "And on a similar topic, could tell us when you'll complete your roll-out of multicast and what technical requirements that needs and any barriers you're having to overcome as you through that?,1,2\n",
      "A: Okay I'll own that and be very careful of manage what you say.,1,1\n",
      "The last two weeks have been really good.,4,1\n",
      "The answer is yes, we have seen an increase in the take-up but one would rather hope after we've advertised it that we would.,3,1\n",
      "And so it's been - has been encouraging over the last few weeks, but it is only the last few weeks, so good start there.,3,1\n",
      "And in terms of unified set-top box, yes, absolutely, that's the intent and I think that's the indication I gave to previous question in terms of bringing together in a single box that does everything.,1,1\n",
      "Multicasting, we're rolling out to save existing boxes and as we get towards the unified box then we'll have multicasting on that as well.,2,1\n",
      "So we're first of all, giving it to the install base of customers.,1,1\n",
      "Okay, thanks.,2,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Your next question comes from Carl Murdock-Smith, JPMorgan.,1,1\n",
      "Please proceed.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Good morning.,1,1\n",
      "Two questions, please.,3,1\n",
      "Firstly on global services, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the strong order intake, particularly if the strength, is it to one or two big contracts or is it lots of smaller contracts?,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, on Openreach, so I was just wanting a bit more commentary around the lead times.,1,1\n",
      "How you say lead times develop now versus last quarter and historically with the more resources, are they starting to get back to normal and a sense of how much of the 48,000 growth in physical launch this quarter was at the results of you getting in control and the more resource coming in that?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay, and so you're moving house shortly, Carl, was that the question?,1,1\n",
      "Q: I'm very worried, I'm very worried, that's why.,1,5\n",
      "A: First of all, on global services, no there isn't a mega deal in there, this is lots of deals.,1,1\n",
      "I mean some of them at least in size were not - we haven't been gaining multi-hundreds and millions of pounds deals in there.,1,1\n",
      "I think there's more renewals, but not mega deals, there's more renewals in there but there's made up of loss of orders I think rather than the big order book.,1,3\n",
      "Luis, do you want to add anything?,1,1\n",
      "A: I think that very good couple of examples that we mentioned was to put a little bit more color on that as you said there.,4,1\n",
      "For example Novartis was a renewal of what we have with them, but we have added also.,1,1\n",
      "As you know, they have acquired Alcon that is a leading player in the eye services industry and that is adding part of 65 sites around the globe.,1,1\n",
      "And, we'll have to combine that which is a renewal and extension with new brands as National Bank of Abu Dhabi who wants to be the best Arab bank in the world and we are helping them to centralize all their IT and telecommunications and so on, and the same thing with Clarins where we have been competing with.,2,1\n",
      "So, I think it's a good combination of renewals and extensions and new brands other than [indiscernible] services.,3,1\n",
      "A: Thanks, Luis.,1,1\n",
      "And we've seen [indiscernible] second but we have seen, yes, an improvement in the outstanding base of orders that we're working through.,3,1\n",
      "We are hoping for some dry weather one day but, Liv?,2,1\n",
      "A: Yes you could just call if you are moving house is where we're then probably literally about 10 days as being perfectly back on the agreed [indiscernible] .,3,1\n",
      "So the agreed [indiscernible] time for a new customer provided is 13 working days, so just over couple of weeks.,1,1\n",
      "And we've seen 14 days in the last few days and gradually improving over the last few months.,2,1\n",
      "So, yes, so we think - we know with all the resources that's come in have made that difference and that the backlog of orders that was caught up in the, just sheer scale of [indiscernible] [indiscernible] is almost .,1,1\n",
      "So, I think you've seen that.,1,1\n",
      "Your other part of the question was whether we're still seeing ongoing and I guess copper growth across markets, so we'll continue to see demand for copper continuing.,1,1\n",
      "So, it's not just as we are still seeing the copper continuing to be a desire, probably leads to fibre orders as well.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks for that.,2,1\n",
      "Next question.,1,1\n",

      "Just a couple please.,3,1\n",
      "On the savings, I know, can I have a shot at savings at least?,1,2\n",
      "I mean the move to tech services and operations seems pretty substantial so in very general terms, does that mean the savings for the business before Global Services, the core business, could even accelerate or stay similar and then you could add Global Services savings on top?,3,1\n",
      "And then secondly, back on Vision again, could you just explain why December quarter was slow which is 20,000 or 21,000 take-up of Vision and people waiting for YouView.,1,1\n",
      "What's the dynamic there please?,3,1\n",
      "A: I think this is an excellent one and let me address that.,3,1\n",
      "I think we didn't advertise Vision until the new year and I think - and it's just we're holding far a bit until we felt we had enough stocks so we're able to accelerate, and we have seen an acceleration since then.,1,1\n",
      "So we're not unhappy, as I said on the quarter before and - but I think our focus is very much going to be in this calendar year and that focus will increase as we get into the summer quarters and that's where we put our focus.,1,1\n",
      "So Vision, we're absolutely happy with.,3,1\n",
      "In terms of savings, I think we quite recognize your description of that core and global is two different things.,1,1\n",
      "And, what we'll do in Q4 now, [indiscernible] and in Q4 I think we'll talk about better, but overall savings plans on the scale of sort of this next phase of savings potential across the business.,2,1\n",
      "It's not just Global Services and the new TSO organization and that's important.,1,1\n",
      "There's a number of other things across the business, particularly driving end-to-end processes, and Tony has mentioned this in previous quarters, this would be our particular focus that will improve customer service.,2,1\n",
      "And, I think it was out in the business and which is our cost, but Tony, anything more to add?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I mean if you look what we're doing here is we're able to operate business, a chunk, the majority of it will move into merging with the Design business, but there are other pieces in there that's happening in terms of the overseas activities where we're merging what happened within Operate, what happened within the Design businesses into Global Services so that you have one organization operating overseas while the integrated process from order entry to service delivery going through one coordinator in overall process.,1,1\n",
      "Within the Wholesale business, the support activity, the engineering of course that's supporting that, the order entry is being all merged together.,2,1\n",
      "This was work that was previously done within Operate.,1,1\n",
      "We're moving some Design staff into Global Services within the UK.,1,1\n",
      "But this is about integration and single unified processes across the business, across all the lines of business.,1,1\n",
      "I mean it's not something that's specific to any area.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you, Nick.,2,1\n",

      "The next question is from Paul Sidney from Credit Suisse.,1,1\n",
      "Please proceed.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you very much.,1,1\n",
      "Just two quick questions please.,3,1\n",
      "Firstly, BT saw a slight pickup in wholesale fibre ads in the quarter.,1,1\n",
      "I was just wondering, is there any way which BT can further incentivize and other operators had to resell when we choose fibre products.,1,1\n",
      "And the second question is, on sort of the BDUK contracts won so far, at what level of premises connected with that to you too if you take those contracts?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: In terms of BDUK, most of the contracts are 90%-plus of these areas.,1,1\n",
      "So a comment I've made before, if we take all of the BDUK together, yeah and it's not if we'll win all of them.,1,1\n",
      "But if we did, we think the possibility for the UK is to get well into the big 90% of the UK covered with fibre, whereas 93%, 94%, 95%, a bit early to tell.,1,1\n",
      "But that would be our expectation and the contracts are mainly 90%-ish of these rural areas.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the hiccup, I think we recognize a hiccup in terms of wholesale fibre.,1,1\n",
      "Q: It was a pickup.,1,1\n",
      "A: Pickup, I thought you said hiccup so our wrong in which case I'm right there and I didn't see.,1,2\n",
      "I could've given you an explanation for it then.,1,1\n",
      "Pickup, yes, we have seen a pickup.,1,1\n",
      "We've seen a pickup in both retail and wholesale fibre.,1,1\n",
      "And the answer is just as more communication provided into it.,1,1\n",
      "To be honest, our retail business has pushed fibre, advertised, invested in it and made it a priority.,1,1\n",
      "A number of other players, I think, were very interested in just keeping at that with their previous generation technology that - because it suited them for their investment in LOU and the like and - but the customer ultimately, I think the customers are showing that they really value fibre and want it and I think they'll come in.,3,1\n",
      "We already incentivized wholesale fibre by having a really low price and also a volume discount for this.,1,3\n",
      "And, I think it's one of the most attractive wholesale fibre places anywhere in Europe, and the reason why it's so attractive this is what fill the network.,2,1\n",
      "And so we're pleased with the progress.,3,1\n",
      "I think the smaller ISPs are actually doing very well.,1,1\n",
      "I think we've seen really good engagement from them and I think we'll see more from some of the larger over time.,4,1\n",
      "In the meantime, and I've said this before, the Retail part of the business thinks that fibreing up the UK and making sure the UK connected is important for UK and we believe that as BT as a whole.,1,1\n",
      "Other people maybe don't have the belief in connecting up the UK as being as high on their list of priorities, but that will be their position over time.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you very much.,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "The next question comes from Jerry Dellis, Jefferies.,1,1\n",
      "Please proceed.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yes, good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Just two questions, please.,3,1\n",
      "One related to the new restructuring program.,1,1\n",
      "I just wonder whether we should consider this as being a necessity if you like to deliver the existing guidance.,2,1\n",
      "I'm thinking particularly of 2.5 billion free cash flow number for FY 2015 or does this new program provide you with potential upside to those - to that existing guidance once the plans are finalized.,1,1\n",
      "And then second question is about just sort of the improving trend in revenues ex-transit.,2,1\n",
      "As far as the third quarter number was probably aided to a degree by - from the phasing of the Global Services contract milestones last year, and I think there was also a benefit in business Retail from stopping selling IT hardware.,1,1\n",
      "So as going forward, the question is, you're guiding to further stabilization in revenues of transit, what would be the major drivers of that, please?,3,2\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Right.,1,1\n",
      "On the - first of all, the existing guidance from the restructuring with the group.,1,1\n",
      "On Q4, we will talk about guidance going forward.,1,1\n",
      "I think it is fair to say this improves intakes but also that if we spend money in restructuring, I think the return will be very attractive.,3,1\n",
      "So what we'll do is we'll give you an update I think on guidance and we remain positive and confident in the future on the ability of - as a business to generate increased cash flow.,3,1\n",
      "Beyond that, I think we'll give you an update to reflect also the transformation exercise where we referred to this -- in this quarter and the impact that we'll have.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of revenue trends, the - what we said is H1 was better than - H2 was better than H1 in terms of revenue trends and that's not exactly what you'd seen in this quarter and you'll see next quarter.,2,1\n",
      "And, I think if you look at some of the physical numbers, they're also better, some of the growth in fibre, in broadband, in lines, in order books, so some encouraging things, and we continue to expect to make progress.,3,1\n",
      "But, Tony, I think you want to add about either of these items.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "Look, there was no phasing benefit from Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "It's just a straight improvement in the quarter and we expect that improvement to continue.,2,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay, next question.,1,1\n",

      "Please proceed.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Morning guys and thanks for taking my questions.,2,1\n",
      "Firstly, on the fibre roll out.,1,1\n",
      "Can you just help me understand the profile of that in terms of homes passed by Openreach and then how many homes are marketable in the Retail segment?,1,1\n",
      "And is that changed relative to previous quarters?,1,1\n",
      "And then also just the CapEx dynamics between the actual build costs and then the connection or activation costs?,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: I'll actually talk about the CapEx dynamic between the build costs and that we - the connection costs are pretty straightforward really and there is a charge for the service provider, but I'll ask Liv to just comment on that.,3,2\n",
      "In terms of - there's a gap of about 10 days between something being built and handed over to our retail business - hander over back to all the CPs.,1,1\n",
      "And so roughly, if you say we do 100,000 a week, there's roughly about 150,000 gap that's very broadly the parameters.,1,2\n",
      "So, we're over 13 million in Openreach so it'd be 150,000 behind.,1,1\n",
      "I mean the important thing to think about if you actually look, I think we've over the course of last year tripled the Retail fibre base, and over the course of the last year, and we - many of the areas we've got - in Retail principal have fairly small amount of time because we've just been building so fast.,1,1\n",
      "But we are seeing good take up in these areas and if an area for instance is a couple of years, will be available in a couple of years we are seeing good double digit, strong double digit, double digit penetration coming through there, and Northern Ireland is probably the best example where is the segment we have more fibre connections in BT Northern Ireland, Retail business and we've got copper.,3,1\n",
      "So, so good progress but it's about a 10-day gap between it being available for service provider and having been built and commissioned by Openreach.,4,1\n",
      "Liv, on connections -,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, on connections an most of our connections are FTTC connections, the fibre-to-the-cabinet connections and the CT pays either on management installation or a base connection fee depending on the communications provider, so that could be 86 or that could 105, depends what service you've decided to go for.,1,1\n",
      "So that's kind of how connections work.,2,1\n",
      "And, obviously it most CapEx affected, we would have CapEx for the build cost as you say, and then we'd have CapEx for the connection costs.,1,1\n",
      "So it's just looks very, very simply math-wise.,1,1\n",
      "So I guess I'm not sure whether we're missing something as to the question, but...,1,2\n",
      "Q: Yeah what's the kind of the split between the actual connection costs and in the build costs, I mean to when the customer actually connects?,2,1\n",
      "A: The build cost is the big cost for FTTC.,1,1\n",
      "Connecting is about sending an engineer around - because it's copper at the end so it's a pretty simple connection and that's not capital item, its expense, so the capital is in the build cost.,3,2\n",
      "A: It's all in the build.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay, yes.,1,1\n",
      "Any update on having a self- install option as well, just on that too.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, So in order to have a self-install option, we have decided to do the standard activity which we're working close with the industry and that requires all of industry to agree some elements around standards perhaps underway.,1,1\n",
      "We also need to do to a decent trial, and that requires industry to get a couple of thousands trialists signed up.,1,1\n",
      "Industry, we've got some big players, all big players are committed to try this.,1,1\n",
      "We're in the process of working out from their systems angle, when they can get a trial of some board, how their systems can work and also equipment and stuff.,1,1\n",
      "So, actively pushing it to be ready, we always said that we've looked to be ready late summer with the self-install product.,1,1\n",
      "It will come down to when the CTs have filed the scale.,1,1\n",
      "By then, so from our side, and we'll have our share of the work done, and we'll probably be able to just give you an update as to how we're getting on with signing of trialists at the next results.,1,1\n",
      "But, I think it'll come down to that.,1,1\n",
      "So it'll be - it's all imminent I guess in terms of working hard to get this trial up and running.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks very much.,2,1\n",

      "Hi.,1,1\n",
      "Just a couple for me though.,1,1\n",
      "I want to come back to YouView, I'm sorry.,1,2\n",
      "I just - really try to understand when you make a sort of a more conservative because disagrees with that consumer proposition still a bit a confused and I know there's some gating facts.,1,2\n",
      "Maybe you could walk us through those.,1,1\n",
      "I mean as far I understand, there's still some sort of PVR functionality issues around IP and multicast?,1,1\n",
      "Obviously, you want along - you want the sports channel around as well, I guess more into the fibre and your deal with Sky.,1,1\n",
      "So when you put all that together, are we thinking sort of April, May, for a kind of more concerted single platform to share in YouView?,2,1\n",
      "That would be really helpful.,3,1\n",
      "And secondly, a question on regulation, I guess we're getting a little anesthetized, I'm sure you're not with the kind of indignant press releases on Ethernet pricing, ladder pricing.,2,3\n",
      "Is there anything you can do to kind of stop this one-way traffic again?,2,1\n",
      "Do you think you're going to the right place?,1,1\n",

      "I share your frustration and I think what happened in Ethernet was a completely unexpected consequence and of a legal technicality.,1,3\n",
      "And, we don't think it's - we don't think the answer is the right answer legally and certainly, and I think there's a fairly widespread view not economically or morally and are we pretty fair?,3,1\n",
      "That's about it, yeah we share that.,1,1\n",
      "And, I think certainly, there is an industry now which - among the CPs which is I think sometimes are employing more lawyers than they are engineers.,1,1\n",
      "And I think that's not good, it's not good for the industry.,1,2\n",
      "It's not good for the customer because I don't think any of these people were rushing to pass the money back to customers.,1,2\n",
      "I think it's clearly gone into the P&L and their bonuses, et cetera and so it's not a great situation.,3,1\n",
      "Now we are - are we upping our regulatory effort?,1,1\n",
      "Yes, we are.,1,1\n",
      "And I think we'll be pushing hard to make sure that it's not these unintended consequences.,1,1\n",
      "And, I think Ofcom have recognized this in terms of that the some of the work on - some of the recent proposals haven't had a mixture of obligations, which have really been having basically a mixture of price control and the cost orientation obligation with the real problem with Ethernet, and I think Ofcom have recognized that an created an unfair position.,1,2\n",
      "So, we're going to be pushing back and pushing back aggressively on that regulated point of view.,1,3\n",
      "As I said, I don't think it was Ofcom's intent.,1,1\n",
      "But there is an industry, we've seen many things where people appeal 32 different points of a price review and if they're wrong in 31 of them, it doesn't matter because it's a one-way bet.,1,2\n",
      "And, I think Ofcom will probably share some of that frustration and we'll - in the past, we've tried to respect the regulatory process and get a sensible answer.,3,3\n",
      "We also have to be clear and make sure we protect all of our legal rights going forward.,1,1\n",
      "And yes, we're putting more resource into doing just that.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of YouView, very simply, the boxes will converge, we expect it in time for the - time for launch of BT Sports.,1,1\n",
      "So that will be a single box.,1,1\n",
      "It does multicast, the conditional acts will be able to call sport and that will be then.,1,1\n",
      "At the moment for most customers, it's pretty straightforward.,3,1\n",
      "There's not actually too much confusion.,1,1\n",
      "If they want - if they want sport, they get one box.,1,1\n",
      "If they don't want sport, they get another box.,1,1\n",

      "A couple of questions.,1,1\n",
      "And I'm kind of sorry, we've already chased you a lot on the cost side especially associated with Vision and TV, et cetera.,2,2\n",
      "But is there any materiality or any guidance you can give us on sort of cost spent to date on production and et cetera, just so we can get an idea of what the real sort of underlying costs movements are in the business.,1,1\n",
      "And I appreciate that, that might be a touch difficult.,2,2\n",
      "Then second of all, you've obviously acquired the content, the football content in various other sources.,1,1\n",

      "No, I can't give you any more information.,1,1\n",
      "We've said we'll always be open.,1,1\n",
      "We expect to be multi-channel and not multi-platform.,1,1\n",
      "It depends exactly whether that's a wholesale or resale relationship.,1,1\n",
      "We have no fundamental opposition to wholesalers, we are happy wholesalers across the whole of our business, have always been so and we expect to continue to be so.,2,2\n",
      "Just as a matter of the price, if the deal's right, we'll wholesale it.,1,1\n",
      "If the deal's not right, then we won't and that is very simple.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the costs, we talked about 0.25 billion of savings last quarter and over a 1 billion of savings year-to-date.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the production costs of BT Sport, as much as it's - I know it's a really exciting area, it's really not that material at this point against it.,4,1\n",
      "What really is - as we start to actually produce the thing then you'll get more of it.,1,1\n",
      "But important, most importantly is that it's going to be the amortization of the right acquisition costs, which start when we actually start, when the seasons starts.,1,1\n",
      "So, we whilst we have spent already multi-millions on this, there's many other developments to spend multi-millions on the people don't talk about all of the business, so really we're not asking for any sort of say where we spent millions on this.,1,1\n",
      "It's certainly the impact that's being a lot less that's been the effect of the rain on Openreach last quarter as an example.,1,1\n",

      "Firstly, depreciation versus CapEx, should we expect depreciation to start falling towards the CapEx level, and if so, over how many years?,1,2\n",
      "And then secondly, what were the exceptional costs?,4,1\n",
      "Is it possible to give us an idea of what we're talking about here?,1,1\n",
      "Are we talking about single millions per quarter or tens of millions per quarter?,1,1\n",
      "A: The overall scale of the aesthetic item, it will over a period.,1,1\n",
      "It will be I think hundreds of millions over the - going into next year is what including next year as well.,1,1\n",
      "So I think we are talking about quite significant changes in the relationship of the business and the scale of the opportunities there.,1,1\n",
      "And in terms of depreciation, depreciation is trending down and I think we'll give in Q4 a bit more guidance.,1,2\n",
      "But over time, yes, it will over time trend down towards our CapEx level.,1,1\n",
      "I think you've already started to see some of that trending down happening, and you'll continue to see we've been spending at the sort of 2.5, 2.6 level now for a number of years and eventually that - the depreciation starts to come down.,1,2\n",
      "I think fair to say we've been pretty conservative in the way we've been depreciating assets and that's the right way to be.,3,1\n",
      "But yeah, you will continue to see it trending down.,1,1\n",
      "I think we'll try and give some guidance on that number I think as we - in Q4 when we move forward to future years.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Sorry.,1,1\n",
      "Were you talking about hundreds of millions of exceptionals due to the wet weather?,1,1\n",
      "A: Sorry, sir.,1,1\n",
      "I misunderstood you.,1,2\n",
      "I thought you were talking about restructuring.,1,1\n",
      "No, it's a few tens of millions, 10 million, 20 million, that sort of amount in the quarter, so a double digit but not well into double digits.,1,1\n",
      "Sorry, I did, I thought you're talking about the specific item we'd refer to in the - going through the course of next year.,1,2\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "The next question is from James Ratzer, New Street Research.,1,1\n",
      "Please proceed.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you very much.,2,1\n",
      "I have two questions please.,3,1\n",
      "The first one was one it's on your CapEx sale was encouragingly low in the quarter and once we go forward into the next few years as fibre builders increasingly completed in fibres, probably more efficient than copper.,2,2\n",
      "I mean is your CapEx guidance of 2.6 billion looking too high, I mean why shouldn't that start to come down quite a bit from this level?,1,1\n",
      "And then the second question was on the revenue trends in BT Retail and since fibre has launched and you've knocked off 15% of your base already taking the product, but during that period BT retail revenues were actually down about I think about 6% or 7%.,1,1\n",
      "So what can we see happening to cause that trend to inflect, start to stabilize or unfortunately, do you think retail revenues still remain under pressure going forward?,1,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: I think on retail revenue, as I mentioned today, we kept - we held our prices throughout 2012 unlike some other players.,1,1\n",
      "We didn't increase key prices and if you look at the line revenue for instance, you see a big drop off.,1,2\n",
      "Actually, the other numbers are very encouraging.,3,1\n",
      "I think what's encouraging certainly in that in terms of broadband and fibre growth, you see that coming through the numbers as the convergence revenues are up, I think you'll see improvements in BT business.,2,1\n",
      "We've mentioned that already.,1,1\n",
      "So I think just - yes, I think the physicals are good and you'll see, perhaps, the numbers follow on from that, so I'm very happy with that.,3,1\n",
      "In terms of CapEx, the fibre program hasn't finished.,1,1\n",
      "We've got a lot more to do.,1,1\n",
      "When the fibre program does finish, will that improve CapEx?,2,1\n",
      "Well I think it'll equal absolutely.,1,1\n",
      "But in the meantime, we are busy rolling out to lots of - we've got still some more in our commercial roll-out program to do, although we're making very, very good progress.,4,1\n",
      "But we've also got BDUK and we'll be moving as quickly as we can on the BDUK stuff.,1,1\n",
      "And so we're recruiting people.,1,1\n",
      "So, we were saying CapEx from that.,1,1\n",
      "But overall, we continue to get more efficient in our CapEx.,1,1\n",
      "But, we're not - we're most definitely not finished in terms of the fibre program, but we're making really good progress, and the great news is of course once you build the thing that - as you sign up customers, your signing up customers are - will be good margin - so return on the capital you've already spent.,4,1\n",
      "So, we're kind of progressing.,3,1\n",
      "CapEx is being done efficiently and effectively and we're going as fast as we can on fibre and other programs.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",

      "So how much of that is sort of directly revenue-related and how much of that is actually what I'll call core fixed costs being taken out to the business and therefore is sustainable into the longer term?,1,1\n"

      "So it's a question of how much bandwidth you throw at it and we'll be tripling the bandwidth I think over the course of the - this calendar year.,1,1\n",
      "So that will give us lots more opportunities to deliver more channels.,1,1\n",
      "And of course, you got channels delivered with a single box in YouView over 3G air as well.,1,1\n",
      "So you have a range of different options about how you deliver things.,1,1\n",

      "Over half, slightly over half the cost.,1,1\n",
      "Costs that are non-revenue related on the slide.,1,1\n",

      "Look, the bulk of it, the costs that we take out are long-term.,1,1\n",
      "They are sustainable.,1,1\n",

      "Just a couple of questions from me.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly, Ian in your commentary, you talked about, in Global Services, things sort of not seeing incremental work, perhaps some sign of improvement.,2,1\n",
      "Could you perhaps give a little color in terms of whether we're seeing any improvement specifically in the UK?,2,1\n",
      "And also just with respect to medium-sized businesses as well, how is the macroenvironment is developing?,3,1\n",
      "And then just secondly, there was a reference to the debt profile.,1,1\n",
      "I know in the previous set of results, you talked about how the opportunity for potential savings around interest is sort of a more medium-term issue.,2,1\n",
      "Has anything sort of changed around that thing?,1,1\n",
      "Are any opportunities developing in the debt market to potentially improve the rate of interest that is being paid?,2,1\n",
      "A: The - on the - I'll let Tony talk about debt profile.,1,1\n",
      "On the Global Services, yes, it's difficult one quarter to get to too much of a view.,1,2\n",
      "I think I would say overall the UK is probably a bit less worse which seems to be the phrase at the moment and I think that's true both in the large corporates and the SME sector.,2,3\n",
      "Government expenditure, I think, remains subdued.,1,1\n",
      "But a lot of our UK customers are big globals, customers and that's - so are they impacted by the UK economy or otherwise?,1,1\n",
      "But UK is still difficult, not as difficult as Southern Europe, but certainly it doesn't look like the high-growth economies.,2,2\n",
      "SMEs, I think because of many things, there remains a headwind with SMEs, but we think it remains a real opportunity with the SME market, and a lot of this is about how you grow your market share.,1,1\n",
      "If you look at the total ICT market for SMEs, we've got sort of 10% market share.,1,1\n",
      "So, whilst in communication, we've be gaining market share, certainly according to our Ofcom numbers for a number of quarters, and it's been against a declining market and that's been problematical as we've got a 40%-odd market share in that, and that's difficult to overcome the declining market.,1,2\n",
      "But in ICT, in the IT market where we've got a low market share, actually those that grow our market share is the most important thing.,1,2\n",
      "And I think we remain positive on our opportunity in the SME market.,3,1\n",
      "On debt, Tony?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "If you look at slide 8, it shows the profile of the debt that we've got coming forward.,1,1\n",
      "But very simplistically, in terms of interest payments, the 1.4 billion that we paid down, we're going to have savings on 5.7%, which is the average coupon rate over that.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the ability to buy back old debt, I can't get that to be NPV-positive and we're not going to do anything unless we can make it NPV-positive.,3,1\n",
      "So that will just have to flow through.,1,1\n",
      "If opportunities come up that allow us to do that, then we'll take it.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "Next question?,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "The next question comes from Adam Rumley, HSBC.,1,1\n",
      "Please proceed.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "I have just a couple of questions on the fibre deployment.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly, do you think the government is satisfied with the progress?,3,1\n",
      "I'm sure they are, but are they happy with the fact that you're winning all the BDUK project contracts?,2,1\n",
      "And then secondly, are you concerned about state aids and the risk that the government funds could be directed towards parallel fibre builts within cities?,1,2\n",
      "I'm thinking here particularly of Birmingham.,1,1\n",
      "And then finally, I just wondered if you could give us an update on the retail side of the customers taking the upper tier of fibre products if it's still the majority?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: The last time we talked about retail customers.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of pace, I think it would be difficult for people - people certainly should be satisfied with the fastest in the world.,2,2\n",
      "And I don't - I think - I'm not aware of an interplanetary contest on this, but we're doing well as far as Earth is concerned, the fastest also - and we're working with government very closely to see how we can go faster because many of the things are things like planning issues, electricity supply and trying to remove these obstacles.,2,2\n",
      "We've recruited 1,000 people this year to help in the build, many of them from the Armed Forces.,1,1\n",
      "And I said many times, we don't think we will win every area.,1,1\n",
      "There will probably be somebody who will win.,1,1\n",
      "The reason we're winning is actually because we've got an industrialized process and we're prepared to commit the investment.,2,1\n",
      "It's sort of, that's not our fault.,1,2\n",
      "But one thing is when we win, we've got open platforms that allow anyone to sell the service.,1,1\n",
      "So actually, the UK's in a much better position if BT wins with its open platform.,2,1\n",
      "A whole range of service providers already have the systems to provide this and that's why you've got 60 or 70 people providing - offering fibre to customers from BT, whereas if you look at some of those specialized projects like in South Yorks, I think they've done a sort of 100 or few hundred connections from a few service providers.,2,1\n",
      "So I don't think that's good for the UK and it doesn't - more importantly, I don't know if that's good for customers.,3,1\n",
      "And in terms of cities, I think we and Virgin, we share the same view that the Birmingham program was - has not been well thought out.,1,1\n",
      "I think in the UK, we should really be focusing at where there isn't an infrastructure, rather than where there already is and particularly focus nearer such as business parts, which may have been a bit more difficult to reach.,1,2\n",
      "And we both grudging ourselves when we say to government not a terribly sensible way and I hope Birmingham will come up with a new set of proposals because the current one is, I think would be a real example of your money as a taxpayer being wasted on the - and will stifle some of the otherwise investment that would be in Birmingham.,3,4\n",
      "So I think it's a - hopefully the government will come up with a different answer and certainly, we've been working with a number of cities as I'm sure other operators have to really identify how we can turbo-charge businesses because that's what the UK needs, is businesses being turbo charged by having fibre where they've not got available rather than giving them an alternative fibre to one that already is.,1,2\n",
      "Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "And I think we're at the - oh, sorry.,1,2\n",
      "Gav, sorry, apologies.,1,2\n",

      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: On the second one, not really, it depends what happens.,1,1\n",
      "I think a couple of things.,1,1\n",
      "First of all, what happens on BDUK in terms of the particular mix that the local authority is looking for but also on, I think the, changing some of the rules regarding access to multi-dwelling units is really important because one of the points we're making to government that we would do more fibre to the premise if we could actually get into the premise and some owners in apartment blocks, leaseholder, fee holder is not being terribly helpful, not in some cases.,2,4\n",
      "But actually, the important thing is the point we made before is we intend to make fibre to the premise available to anyone who has got - where fibre of the cabinet is available.,1,1\n",
      "So, the answer is going to be, over 90% of the UK should have ultimately have fibre to the fence available to them if they want to use it by a fibre to the premise on demand product and I think it's really important to say what we're trying to do is deliver speeds that are currently 80 meg and will be over 100 meg per second and maybe even more to all customers and for those customers, of which I don't there will be an enormous number that say, actually I want to be at multi-hundred megabytes per second because let's say I am a small business who is very IT intensive or whatever and I think there will be a huge number of these, I want to do something more than that, that will be available to them.,1,1\n",
      "But we are getting the best of both worlds by having the speeds and price associated with FTTC as we roll out and also the availability for those people who want to under FTTP and I think that's a really good answer and I think it's something a of number of countries had been looking at.,4,1\n",
      "It was interesting to hear, for instance, Malcolm Turnbull of Australia commenting that the Australian fibre program should really look to copy BT in the UK and I think that's really a first that having someone from Australia say we should copy the UK and - so that's in terms of the speed.,2,1\n",

      "Q: Churn effects.,1,1\n",
      "A: Of the prices, I thought - I particularly can't remember we - I'll ask Gavin to comment, but one of the things, people tend to comment on price increases and not price reductions and we've been in the market place where actually we've seen aggressive offers on broadband on one side and probably certain inflation cost increases in line rental, albeit we froze our prices through the course of last year, but Gavin, do you want to?,1,3\n",
      "A: I think you captured the point I was going to make [indiscernible] .,1,2\n",
      "I wouldn't - I'd see a marginal effect of any price change in January, though I would expect to see one and you've got to balance the promotions and the new propositions that we've got coming through on broadband and fibre and TV against any of - anything on the price increase side of things, so I think it will be a marginal effect.,1,2\n",
      "A: People few tend to see - because newspapers cover price increases rather than price reductions but the UK remains one of the cheapest places to buy telecommunication.,1,2\n",
      "For instance, 30-40% cheaper than the US which is quite remarkable and that, I think that's quite an interesting statistic.,2,2\n",
      "And if you look against continental Europe, very much the same story; the UK is one of the cheapest markets anyway.,1,2\n",

      "53,000 didn't look huge compared to previous quarters in the numbers?,1,1\n",

      "Thanks very much.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, let me answer the second one first, Nick, to clarify any misunderstanding.,1,2\n",
      "We are open to wholesale arrangements with Sky.,1,1\n",
      "We have an ongoing dialogue.,1,1\n",
      "They are a big customer of ours.,1,1\n",
      "We'd like to be a bigger customer of theirs.,2,1\n",
      "Within the quarter, we did a deal on Sky Movies to distribute Sky Movies over our TV platform.,1,1\n",
      "So I think that demonstrates that there is the potential to do more business together.,1,1\n",
      "On the sport front, there's no deal imminent at the moment but there is no reason why we couldn't at some point in the future.,1,1\n",
      "It's just about finding the right compromise, I guess, somewhere between us, and at the moment, there's a gap.,1,1\n",
      "So philosophically and I think you can see this in some of our other arrangements, we're not against wholesaling and that's why we're able to wholesale, I think, and come to an agreement with Virgin Media for BT Sport.,1,1\n",
      "It's just that we're not in that position with Sky at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "So I think that's true about the current BT Sport proposition.,2,1\n",
      "And when we add Champions League and UEFA Europa Cup from 2015-2016 onwards, in that respect, philosophically, it doesn't change anything.,3,1\n",
      "It'll be still part of - it'll be part of the BT Sport proposition.,1,1\n",
      "And if there is a way of coming to a negotiated agreement with Sky, then it will be part of the negotiation that we have.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of TV, well, TV ads are up year-on-year and 53,000 is a decent number.,1,1\n",
      "We've said all along, the sport investment is fundamentally about driving broadband for us.,1,1\n",
      "It's about changing the dynamics in the broadband market.,2,1\n",
      "Some of that will have a halo effect on TV, but we'll only look to acquire TV customers that are going to be profitable over the long term to our consumer business.,2,1\n",
      "So, it's a good number and you'll see it, I think, continue to grow going forwards because we've got some very exciting plans to strengthen the proposition over the next few quarters.,4,1\n",
      "And I was particularly encouraged within the quarter to see the number of customers taking our suite of IP channels continuing to increase.,2,1\n",
      "So, well over 100,000 customers took the IP channels that we offer at part of our TV proposition.,1,1\n",

      "A couple of questions, one sort of generally on your sort of competitive positioning against cable, maybe one for John.,1,1\n",
      "I guess we tend to sort of look at the whole sports investment as a sort of mortal battle against Sky but I supposed the proposition sort of stacks up almost more squarely with cable.,1,2\n",
      "And I know in the past you've had problems with teasing Virgin customers out.,1,2\n",
      "Can you maybe just sort of give us some insight as to how the sports and fibre offering is helping you there and how does the competitive position, the gross adds and churn is maybe changing around your competitive positioning against Virgin?,1,2\n",

      "I'll just say a few words about BT Sport and maybe, John, do you want to pick up the competitiveness of the proposition versus cable.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, overall on sports, we're pleased with the progress we're making.,3,1\n",
      "As I said, we've got over 2.5 million direct customers.,1,1\n",
      "You can add another 2 million through cable, so over 4.5 million in totality.,1,1\n",
      "And I made the reference within the presentation, Steve, that has continued to grow through January.,1,1\n",
      "And I think what we're seeing is that the particularly strong set of games we had across the November-January period has really helped drive overall adoption.,1,1\n",
      "And we've seen it reflected in the viewing figures as well.,1,1\n",
      "So, we're now getting well over 1.5 million viewers for some of the games that we were getting in December, Man City/Liverpool, for example, Man United/Spurs.,1,1\n",
      "We also got over 1.3 million viewers for FA Cup round that we showed in early January as well.,1,1\n",
      "So, it demonstrates that not just the Premier League games are drawing in audiences but also the FA Cup games as well.,1,1\n",
      "Elsewhere, rugby is doing very well for us on the channel.,1,1\n",
      "That's performing extremely well.,1,1\n",
      "And we've got further sports to come, for example MotoGP, as I mentioned comes in the next couple of months.,1,1\n",
      "So, the net-net is the sport investment is performing well.,1,1\n",
      "It's performing well as a channel.,1,1\n",
      "It's performing well in terms of the revenue streams it's bringing in both directly and in terms of stand-alone subs and commercial revenues, but also the halo effect that we've seen on the business.,1,1\n",
      "And to reiterate, we said judge us on whether the consumer revenues and profits grow in the medium term, and you can see having grown consumer revenues I think 4% in Q2, we're up 6% in Q3.,2,1\n",
      "Profits are down 8%, but that's better than we achieved in Q2.,2,1\n",
      "So, we're halfway there.,1,1\n",
      "We've just got to get the profits moving now, but I'm very confident that we will do that in the next few quarters.,3,1\n",
      "So, John, do you want to just talk about...,1,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "A: ...competitive proposition versus - competitiveness of our proposition versus cable?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, I will do.,1,1\n",
      "First, I think it's true that cable remains a good opportunity for us actually.,3,1\n",
      "And the cable base in some sense is a little bit vulnerable because their typical pricing is relatively high for the marketplace.,1,3\n",
      "In terms of the sort of triple-play deals that we both currently offer, for a triple-play deal involving fibre and TV and basic channels and of course BT Sport, the best Virgin price is currently about 28.,2,1\n",
      "For us, it's about 22, so I think that gives us quite a sharp edge to that proposition.,1,1\n",
      "The one thing I would say that's currently kind of working in favor of cable is the switching regime currently gives a save right to cable actually and that's not true for us, but there was a strategy paper from DCMS in July that talked around changing that switching process, so to get a switching process that's truly flat across the market overall.,2,1\n",
      "And I think if that change happens as seems likely, then that's going to give further assistance to our proposition.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "So, sort of small benefits at the moment but looking for a bigger prize as the switching regime is flattened across the market.,3,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, it's probably true .,2,1\n",
      "Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Who's next?,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Next question is from the line of Paul Sidney, Credit Suisse.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you very much.,1,1\n",
      "And just two questions also, please.,3,1\n",
      "Firstly on fibre, the wholesale fibre adds remain relatively modest versus the performance of BT Retail.,1,1\n",
      "I was just wondering, is there anything you could do to further stimulate the take-up of wholesale fibre adds, perhaps even considering reducing the wholesale fibre rate that you charge?,1,2\n",
      "And secondly on cost cutting, maybe a question for Tony.,1,1\n",
      "I think in the past, you've said that there's potentially another billion pounds to shave off the cost base to sort of take you into that top quartile.,1,1\n",
      "And I was just wondering with momentum on cost cutting and the reduction in CapEx guidance today, is the potential for you to achieve that 1 billion perhaps sooner than you thought 12 months ago?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Just I'll ask Liv to comment on the fibre number and then Tony on cost transformation.,1,1\n",
      "But let's be clear, the fibre adds across the business, they're up 70% year-on-year, so I think that's a pretty good performance.,4,1\n",
      "But Liv, do you want to...,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes, I think I was also quite pleased with the fibre adds, 70% up.,3,1\n",
      "The key thing I would say that's happened recently is the fact that we've launched the self-install product, and that's the thing that I guess why the industry has said, it would be one of the things that would make them look to do maybe a little bit more fibre.,1,1\n",
      "So self-install went live towards the tail-end of the quarter just gone.,1,1\n",
      "There will be more volumes over the next couple of quarters on self-install.,1,1\n",
      "So I think that is the key kind of last plank of the things that we've also been asked for.,2,1\n",
      "So that's probably the thing you're looking for as to whether there is some future there.,1,1\n",
      "But actually if you look also year-on-year, the percentage of Retail on the adds is much lower than the externals as well.,1,1\n",
      "So I think if you track it back, it's a pleasing trend, I would say.,3,1\n",
      "Tony?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Just to help on that, the non-retail adds 12 months ago was 20%.,1,1\n",
      "The non-retail adds now is 33%.,1,1\n",
      "So, there's been a 60% uptake in that in percentage terms.,1,1\n",
      "On the position relating to cost transformation, I hope I highlighted the fact that we've continually got examples of opportunities of what we can do.,3,1\n",
      "The 1 billion of that outline target remains unchanged.,1,1\n",
      "And the example I gave on the contact centers was the opportunities I thought we had six months ago in management support of 20 million, now I think that opportunity is 50 million a year.,2,1\n",
      "It's just a prime example of the opportunities that we may have as we continue.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you very much.,1,1\n",

      "I mean how do you look at the consumer line loss, I guess, is the question and how much better do you think it can get?,2,3\n",
      "A: Well, I mean I'll ask Tony to give a bit of perspective on some of the moving parts in a second, but let's be very clear, we've said all along the way to judge this is consumer revenues and profits growing in the medium term.,2,1\n",
      "And you can see the revenues growing over the last couple of quarters, up 6% this quarter, up 4% last quarter and the EBITDA loss reducing quarter-on-quarter.,1,3\n",

      "Just what we have decided, look, there's five ways we monetize, one is wholesale revenues, that's obviously with Virgin; one is direct subscribers; one is the pubs and clubs; one is advertising; and the last piece, which is quite significant is churn.,1,1\n",
      "We'll only get the full impact of the annualized churn when we're 12 months in.,1,1\n",

      "So Luis, do you want add a wee bit more color to that?,1,2\n",
      "A: Yeah, I think that in the quarter as we said, there has been significant contract milestones that has helped to improve the position both on revenue and EBITDA.,2,1\n",
      "But it's true that as Gavin said before, in some of the main markets in which we support our customers, we have seen that the situation less bad than before although still difficult especially in Europe.,2,2\n",

      "Firstly just on cost cutting, does improving customer service just go hand in hand with cost cutting, or does it actually offset some of the cost cutting opportunity?,2,1\n",
      "And maybe more specifically, if we include improving customer service, do you still see a few hundred of millions of underlying cost reduction over the coming years?,2,1\n",
      "And then just on the wholesale negotiations with Sky or potential for negotiations, can you just give us a bit more color on what you see as pros and cons on a wholesale deal with Sky?,1,1\n",

      "These go hand in hand.,1,1\n",
      "So if you reduce the cost of failure, you automatically improve customer service and you also improve your cost base.,2,3\n",

      "Will we make some investments as a result of the savings we make?,1,1\n",

      "And then secondly, just looking at the - almost following up from the in-sourcing cost transformation example that Tony gave in the presentation, lever costs has been coming down in recent years but were actually zero this quarter, is that something we might expect to continue now given the natural attrition in your workforce given the age profile and also given your preference for in-sourcing of work?,1,1\n",

      "I think in terms of pricing, I think the value for money, cost of living debate is live across the UK at the moment.,2,1\n",
      "I think our sector is a very strong story.,1,1\n",
      "There was, I think, a good piece that Ofcom published that was picked by a number of the newspapers this week that demonstrated actually how costs in, for example, broadband had come down dramatically over the last 10 years and there had only been modest increases within the voice market as well.,3,1\n",

      "It strikes me, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that there have been a number of kind of positives year-to-date as you've been bringing down the switched voice revenue, now I think sub-5% of revenues.,3,2\n",
      "I imagine that that's been trending down, that's been coming down with quite a high marginal margin.,1,2\n",
      "So getting it down to a low number has been good, there's been sterling weakness, there's been milestone receipts.,3,2\n",

      "How should we think about sort of 12.5% EBITDA margins in GS and whether that's really sustainable?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, I mean within GS, the point that I wanted to really emphasize is we've been focusing on delivery.,1,1\n",
      "We've been focusing on getting to the right cost base through consistent cost transformation.,1,1\n",
      "And I think over the last few quarters, you've seen the benefit of some of the techniques and approaches that we've used on the rest of BT being applied into the Global Services division.,1,2\n",
      "So there is a different point in the cycle where it's a different point of cycle in Global Services than we are compared with some other parts of BT.,1,1\n",
      "So I think there's more cost transformation to go.,1,1\n",
      "I think you're also right to point out that there are headwinds in the GS market, so some of the big contracts that I think we've had in the government sector for example.,1,1\n",
      "The signs are that those might not be procured in the same way going forwards and that we might need to compete for smaller contracts.,1,1\n",
      "I feel very confident that we'll have a compelling proposition for government, but that's something we need to be wary of, for example.,3,2\n",

      "Luis, any other points?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, yeah, I mean, what I'd say is the key measure for Global Services is not EBITDA margin, it's the cash position.,1,1\n",
      "Our cash position in 2012-2013 was a couple of hundred million cash flow.,1,1\n",
      "There's plenty of opportunities for improvement in Global Services.,2,1\n",
      "We're on the track and the results in the quarter three are reasonably positive.,3,1\n",
      "But in reality, the opportunity within Global Services, I think we all agree and I hope you'd all agree that 200 million cash, which is what we generated last year, is insufficient for a business of this size.,3,2\n",
      "A: Luis, you want to still add a point?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I just want to say that if you looked, as we mentioned, the nine months performance, I think it's where you can see the real underlying improvement, it's 14%, the EBITDA year-on-year.,2,1\n",
      "I think it gives you the clear signal of what is the underlying improvement that is made because we keep winning in the market that 5 billion of ICB.,2,1\n",
      "The revenue last year was going down 8%, so I think that is in a much better position.,2,1\n",

      "Since then, obviously, you've increased EBITDA, slightly lowering CapEx which is probably adding a couple of percentage points to cash flow.,1,1\n",
      "Is there anything else that we should be aware of that is causing a drag and is that something we should be worrying about a little bit more in the midterm please?,3,4\n",
      "A: Tony?,1,1\n",
      "A: There's absolutely nothing else in terms of a drag on working capital.,1,2\n",
      "What we've got is effectively an upgrade in our ratings because we're swallowing the Champions League and that is coming about as a result of improving our EBITDA and reducing our capital.,2,1\n",
      "A: And just to reinforce, there was a one-off within the quarter where one customer paid a couple of days late.,1,1\n",
      "We've got the money on the 2nd of January rather than 31st of December.,1,1\n",
      "A: And just to reiterate, no concerns about hitting our cash flow guidance for the year.,1,2\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "O: The next question, Robert Grindle from Esprito Santo.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning, guys.,3,1\n",
      "Just a quick one for Tony then, given the restatement, your capitalized labor costs kicks up a bit, sort of 15 million to 20 million higher than the sort of last two years quarterly run rate.,1,2\n",
      "Just is there any color behind that, is sort of network building going on or is it going to stay at that level or is it going to come back down to the more normal level?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks so much.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, the numbers are going to bounce around a little bit based on the type of capital investment we're putting in.,1,1\n",
      "I wouldn't see anything of great significance in there.,3,1\n",
      "What we will do is we'll look at - it's about 25% more connections from BDUK then that will cost us something in relation to that labor cost.,1,1\n",
      "But really, that really labor cost number is really a consequence of increased activity and more efficiency.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, very thanks.,3,1\n",
      "A: And our last question?,1,1\n",
      "O: Is from the line of Mandeep Singh, Redburn.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you, guys...,2,1\n",
      "A: Hi, Mandeep.,1,1\n",
      "Q: ...for taking the final question.,1,1\n",
      "Can you hear me clearly?,1,1\n",
      "A: We can.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "So, look, I'm just looking at the sort of cash cost specific items.,1,1\n",
      "If I look at the last few years, excluding this year, you've been at about 1 billion of cash-specific items over the last four years.,1,1\n",
      "They look quite recurring for me, this year consensus is close to 400 million.,1,1\n",
      "And then quite dramatically, that drops off in the next three years to almost flat.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, with core margins ex-global sort of around 50% range, is it realistic to expect?,1,1\n",
      "And obviously, you're promising more cost cuts again.,2,1\n",
      "Is it realistic to think of cash restructuring cost tailing off that significantly or should we just think of these as a recurring cost of business?,1,1\n",
      "A: Tony, do you want to comment?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, sure.,1,1\n",
      "I mean we said last year that we're going to spend roundabout 400 million in terms of our restructuring cost.,1,2\n",
      "We said that this is a benefit - it will be a benefit in relation to our cost saving programs.,1,1\n",
      "And we said, we'll spend the majority of it this year.,1,1\n",
      "There will be some impact next year.,1,1\n",
      "If we've got further programs that we had put in terms of cash specifics, then there will be an ongoing benefit.,1,1\n",
      "Right now we haven't got any plans next year over and above what we've gotten this year.,1,1\n",
      "So, what I'd say is based on our current plans, our current guidance, there's nothing in there.,1,1\n",
      "If we do say we'll do something more, then obviously it will have an incremental impact on our guidance and our EBITDA moving forward.,1,1\n",
      "A: Thanks, Mandeep.,1,1\n",
      "Okay.,1,1\n",
      "I think that it, done.,1,1\n",

      "And if you look back over the last 10 years it's growing consistently at 30% a year.,1,1\n",

      "I think the competitive environment, the key part of it, that most of our competitors do change their prices are about the same time.,1,1\n",

      "First is, there is a bit of seasonality in the quarter, and that is when students take up their line.,1,1\n",
      "There's also been a strong growth in new developments, in new sites some of which still take copper.,1,1\n",
      "And we did run a tight operation in the sense that we did drive our work back down lower, and that played into the numbers, too.,1,1\n",

      "The BDUK fund development that stays in our books is net of any funding we may receive.,1,1\n",
      "Now, the reason I'm sort of [indiscernible] extrapolating on that, the reason that I'm confident that we can manage in relation to the overall envelope of our capital, and cover any further rollouts in terms of increasing speed through G.fast is that; A, we're not going to be spending the sort of CapEx we've been spending to-date in relation to the superfast broadband.,2,1\n",
      "So that becomes available.,1,1\n",
      "We also know that the efficiency and effectiveness of what we are doing with our labor force helps us to drive down unit costs.,1,2\n",
      "And lastly and most importantly, the technology that we've got in relation to G.fast and how that's moved over certainly the last six months leads me to believe that we've got technological improvement in terms of both speed as well as efficiency, as well as cost.,2,1\n",

      "A: I mean, I don't know whether I emphasized enough in my comments.,1,1\n",
      "But we had a couple of breakthroughs on G.fast in the last quarter.,1,1\n",
      "One is the standard is being agreed, which is an important step of course.,1,1\n",

      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I think that on the public sector broadly - well, I've seen any country whenever there are elections coming, there is some slowdown of the number of projects that are launched in government or the new procurement processes that are started.,1,1\n",
      "So in that sense, clearly, it's something that we are experimenting today.,1,1\n",
      "I think that the second thing I would say is that on the existing service that we have been providing, they have really helped transform the way citizens and services have been provided to the communities that we look to what we have been doing in NHS, for example, or in the Ministry of Defense.,1,1\n",
      "But it's also true that some of those businesses have concluded their process of deploying the services as we did in LSP.,2,1\n",

      "And on the corporate sector, well, I think that there are two things, one is more and more what we sell is used by corporate customers.,1,1\n",
      "But it's also true that some of our traditional services like voice of TDM is moving into the IP business line.,2,1\n",

      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Just a couple of other things, this is Tony Chanmugam here.,1,1\n",
      "The first is when you look at those headline numbers, remember the UK number, that's where, where the milestone appeared in.,1,1\n",
      "So you have to take off a few points because we have, roughly speaking, a 60 million milestone in last year.,1,2\n",
      "Secondly, we're also anniversarying out to the local government contracts that we talked about, and that's also impacting here.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think you've got to take - make those two adjustments, still the numbers are down, but the numbers are not as bad as they basically appear at the moment.,1,2\n",
      "Q: Sorry, Tony.,1,1\n",
      "Is there any chance of giving us an idea of [indiscernible] transition from the government contracts might mean?,1,1\n",
      "The milestone is clear but the second point you mentioned.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "We called out - we lost a big - well, we didn't lose it - we didn't bid for a large local government contract for the renewal this year.,1,1\n",
      "And last year, we completely downsize on those.,1,1\n",
      "If you take those two together, did we quoted - yeah, we quoted a number of 100 million.,1,1\n",
      "So you've got to reflect on that and kind of drive that through.,2,1\n",
      "Q: That's great.,3,1\n",

      "Is your proposal effectively to run three networks in parallel, so you'll have the copper network from the central office, the VDSL network from the street cabinet and also G.fast from the distribution point, or are you going to write-off and take out the copper network at some stage?,1,1\n",

      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Okay.,1,1\n",
      "So what we envisaged is that as G.fast rolls out, that will serve higher bandwidth demanding customers.,1,1\n",
      "That service will be made available from cabinet and points closer to the customer.,1,1\n",
      "And it will co-exist with VDSL2+.,1,1\n",
      "So this is a strategy that reuses the existing asset.,1,1\n",
      "And I think Gavin referred to that.,1,1\n",
      "So we have street furniture, cabinets which already have funds laid to them.,1,1\n",
      "So they already have fiber and they already have power.,1,1\n",
      "We will forward power to nodes closer to the customer and not put in new electricity feeds from the electricity suppliers.,1,1\n",
      "So this is about leveraging the existing asset, understanding that customer needs will differ customer-to-customer, but VDSL2+ will serve many, many customers for many, many years and meet fully their needs.,1,2\n",

      "If [indiscernible] is going to be regulated in 2017, would that impact your view on investing in G.fast and investing further in the infrastructure for - in terms of pricing regulation?,1,1\n",
      "And then my second question is just your comment on G.fast earlier where you mentioned reconfiguring the cabinet architecture rather than necessarily rolling out to the distribution point.,1,1\n",
      "I was just wondering whether you can expand on that, whether it would mean significant changes to where cabinets are today rather than actually rolling out all the way the distribution point, and whether that's really you're thinking about it well now?,1,1\n",
      "And then finally, when it comes to...,1,1\n",
      "A: Barry, somebody's on the door.,1,1\n",
      "Q: No, it sounds like it's my door but I apologize.,2,1\n",
      "So the final question is, I realize you're not commenting on the EE sales.,1,1\n",
      "But as a separate point, BT and what it's doing from a technology perspective, in terms of hybrid technology, using the mobile macro network to increase broadband speed for their home customers.,1,1\n",
      "Is that something that you would look to also bring over to the UK, possibly with any kind of higher with EE helping that?,2,1\n",
      "I mean, I realize this technology is owned by Huawei, but I'm just interested whether there are things you could do in the interim between now and 2020, other than G.fast to improve speeds that are maybe not so commonly [indiscernible] ?,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: That was a triple-play of questions with a few door bells in between, Barry.,1,1\n",
      "Let me see.,1,1\n",
      "On regulation, look, I mean, too early to speculate.,1,1\n",
      "We've just entered this, the current three-year period of regulation on fixed access market review.,1,1\n",
      "And so it'd be too early really to speculate about Ofcom's thinking, I think, for 2017.,1,1\n",
      "We will continue to make the point that we made the investment in superfast broadband, an ultrafast in 2010.,1,1\n",
      "And as shareholders we haven't seen a full return from that yet.,1,1\n",
      "And we made the investments on the basis of a fair bet.,2,1\n",
      "So we're in the seven-year - well, in 2017, we'll be seven years into that, and as we've made the point in the past, this is a double-digit year of payback.,1,1\n",
      "So we know that there is an appetite for more and more data.,1,1\n",
      "We know there's an appetite for more and more speed.,1,1\n",
      "And we need to respond to that not just for our own downstream unit customers, but also the market as a whole.,1,1\n",
      "So we would expect, I think, support from a number of CPs who can see the demand amongst their own customer bases.,2,1\n",
      "I think it's also worth making the point that any benchmark, and this is Ofcom data that looks at our wholesale prices today and compares them with other European markets, concludes that we have amongst the lowest wholesale prices in Europe.,1,2\n",
      "So if it comes to 2017, and they're looking to regulate pricing, it's not a guarantee that prices will come down at that point.,1,1\n",
      "So that was the first question.,1,1\n",
      "Now, the second question was about cabinets, wasn't it?,1,1\n",
      "And I'm going to ask my good friend, Clive, to comment on that.,3,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "You asked a question about cabinets and the future of cabinets.,1,1\n",
      "So what we see is that the right reach achievable with G.fast is way better than it was originally anticipated.,2,1\n",
      "So what we now forecast is that we will be able to serve some considerable number of customers with much higher speeds using G.fast electronics from today's cabinets.,1,1\n",
      "That won't suffice for all customers, they might be on - some customers will be on very long copper loops.,1,1\n",
      "And in order to get the same high-grade ultra broadband service to them, we will have to locate mini cabinets closer to some homes.,1,1\n",
      "They are unlikely to be the large green thing that you kind of have in your minds.,2,1\n",
      "They're going to be much smaller units.,1,1\n",
      "Some of them maybe actually physically located in footway boxes that are on the grounds, some may be located at the top of poles.,1,1\n",
      "The key breakthrough though is that we no longer believe that G.fast is only suitable to serve customers when located at all of the distribution points, the 4 million that Gavin referred to, so that we can get away with the topology that leverages the 90,000 cabinets and a modest number of distribution point locations.,1,1\n",
      "A: And I think your third question, Barry, was about whether or not there are innovations that we can learn from in Deutsche Telekom.,1,1\n",
      "Q: I mean, it's one specific innovation, which is they've talked about using the macro mobile networks to basically improve speed.,2,1\n",
      "So [indiscernible] they talk about 6,300 megabits per second using VDSL.,1,1\n",
      "And I was wondering whether that is something that, assuming you owned a macro network in the not too distant future, whether that's something that you would be able to use for your own network in the interim?,1,1\n",
      "A: I mean, we're open to good ideas from any market and anywhere we can find them.,3,1\n",
      "So I mean, if there are good things that DT are doing, we'll look at them.,3,1\n",
      "I am aware of the one you're talking about.,1,1\n",
      "I think our base assumption though is that, provided these pilots that I've talked about in Gosforth and Huntingdon, provided they go well, and that we would see the expansion of G.fast being our primary choice, and that we begin to really gear that up in fiscal 2016-2017.,1,1\n"

      "And everything we've seen to-date in the due diligence process has really supported that.,3,1\n",
      "So hopefully in the next few weeks, we'll be able to bring this to a conclusion.,1,1\n",
      "But we are very much focused on our vision for the future which is really - and it's much more than quad-play, for us it's about the convergence of the networks, and quad-play is just one element of that.,1,1\n",

      "Good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Just one question around the Premier League auction, please.,3,1\n",
      "Obviously, Virgin has applied for these interim measures to hopefully delay the process.,1,2\n",
      "So I just wonder what your attitude towards an auction delay might be given that it might just open up the possibility of a greater number of gains becoming available.,3,2\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: It's one for the Premier League, I'm afraid, Jerry.,1,4\n",
      "It won't be a big surprise that - I think you all expected to have an interest to be bidding when the auction takes place.,2,1\n",
      "Until somebody tells us differently, until somebody says that's not going to happen in the way that it's planned to at the moment, all I can say is we're committed to ensuring that we can get some high-quality games at a good price for our customers.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you very much.,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "The next question is from the line of Stephen Howard, HSBC.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks very much.,2,1\n",
      "I just have a question on Convergence services, please.,3,1\n",
      "If we work on the presumption that fixed line regulation does continue to support the need for investment, and the current, I guess, we might turn for more pricing environment.,2,1\n",
      "Could you perhaps talk a little bit about how you are thinking of positioning yourself in the quad-play market?,1,1\n",
      "And doing so without reigniting a potentially very painful negative-sum game kind of contest that would then surely adversely impact your fixed line broadband pricing?,2,5\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: I mean, in sort of broad terms, I think, we see the market changing, customers' needs changing.,1,1\n",
      "And the appetite for data, wherever you are, be that in the home or outside the home, is increasing and not showing any signs of diminishing.,1,1\n",
      "So we need to design our network and design our propositions for customers with that in mind.,1,1\n",
      "In order to supply it, the most cost-effective way of doing that is to combine the sheer power of a fixed network where it's clear you can deliver high-quality at high-bandwidth most effectively, and combine that with the convenience that comes with Mobility.,1,1\n",
      "But even with the rollout of 4G, you could see the key to 4G is getting more and more points of presence throughout the UK, and at those points of presence, getting it on to the fixed network.,1,1\n",
      "So for us, this is about creating a really cost-effective, high-quality network and then ensuring that actually we can meet the needs of customers, but ensure that margins remain strong as part of it.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Is that a premium product?,1,1\n",
      "It sounds like it.,2,1\n",
      "A: We consider ourselves a premium product today.,1,1\n",
      "And I don't think I particularly want to move away from that.,1,1\n",
      "O: Moving on to our next question, it's from the line of Guy Peddy from Macquarie.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning, all.,3,1\n",
      "A: Hi, Guy.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Just a very quick question and probably much more for Tony.,1,1\n",
      "On the regulated asset base within Openreach, if we look forward on your CapEx plans, especially with your G.fast plans, would you expect to continually see an increase in the asset base of Openreach, or do you just going to sustain the asset base?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Without giving forward guidance, without a phased indication, we're going to continue to invest super fast broadband with the first step G.fast, and second step, a large percentage of our capital spend goes to Openreach and we need to keep investing in those upgrading the network, as well as maintaining the existing networks.,1,1\n",
      "Consequently, I can't see any fundamental shifts, material shifts.,1,1\n",
      "O: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Next question is from the line of Aamod Mishra, Nevsky Capital.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Hi.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning.,3,1\n",
      "A: Good morning, Aamod.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Could I just ask what the attach rate is doing as you rollout your fiber broadband to more premises?,1,1\n",
      "A: The take-up rate?,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "That's right.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, it's increasing quarter-after-quarter.,1,1\n",
      "We're now 17% take up against homes passed.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, it's been ticking up a point, typically a quarter for a number of last couple of years, I would say.,1,1\n",
      "So as you can see in the result, this is overall a record quarter for fiber for us across the Openreach customer base.,1,1\n",
      "And it is a positive thing to say that 44% of that is - with other CPs.,3,1\n",
      "So we designed the business case based on this being taken up across the whole of the market, not just on BT's service provider.,1,1\n",
      "And what we're seeing now is that's really happening.,1,1\n",
      "It's giving what we designed in the first place.,1,1\n",
      "If you wanted to look at the long-term trend, we've gone up about - just under 8 points of take up over the last two years.,1,1\n",
      "So that's sort of if you want to characterize it over a longer period.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Great.,1,1\n",
      "Thanks very much.,2,1\n",
      "O: Next question, Maurice Patrick, Barclays.,1,1\n",
      "A: Hi, Maurice.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, hi guys.,1,1\n",
      "Just, again on the fiber points, even in the past you talked about as fiber penetration has been picking up has being both in the legacy regions but also the new regions picking up as well.,1,1\n",
      "Are we still seeing that trend where penetration is still increasing, even the areas where you rolled out two years, three years ago?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "We're seeing that the - if you look at the cohorts over the - since launch, that those early cohorts are still growing.,1,1\n",
      "So Northern Ireland for example, which is one of the first part of the country that really we deployed into and the government invested into, that is continuing to grow now.,1,1\n",
      "I think it's probably six years, is it, Graham since we started that?,1,1\n",
      "Take up is 24% in Northern Ireland and going up.,1,1\n",
      "Cornwall, which is another very early one is at 29% take up.,1,1\n",
      "And if you look across the rest of the UK, there are now 621 exchanges in the commercial part of the program which were up with take up of over 20%.,1,1\n",
      "So I think you can see there is a real strong demand and things aren't flatting off yet.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Great.,1,1\n",

      "I think the market was expecting a deal by now.,1,1\n",

      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Well, first of all, the reorganization.,1,1\n",
      "What we wanted to do as we were taking ownership of EE was to ensure that we have the right organizational structure to fully take advantage of that.,1,1\n",
      "And we felt that we could better organize around our customers in the UK providing better coverage and better service by combining the traditional focus around SOHO and SME that BT Business has provided with the corporate and public sector coverage that GS has provided, and then wrap the EE B2B business around both of them.,2,1\n",
      "And we just felt that this is a way of ensuring that we could get really strong domestic focus.,1,1\n",
      "We could take - we could recognize that the fact that in a public sector market that the way customers were buying was changing.,1,1\n",
      "It was moving away from central contracts more towards a regional model.,1,1\n",
      "And that we needed to change to reflect that in the way we organized ourselves.,1,1\n",
      "It means that the business will be around about 5 billion in turnover, which conveniently is a very similar size to what the new Global Services business will be.,1,1\n",
      "So, they're roughly the same size in terms of overall turnover, probably a few more people working in GS than the new business in Public Sector division, but roundabout the same size in terms of turnover.,1,2\n",
      "The new Global Services, I think, will be able to focus much more on multinational customers and international customers where we are doing very well.,1,1\n",
      "You could see this in the order book that Luis and the team brought in this quarter.,1,1\n",
      "Strong mix towards growth in new business and we feel as though with more focus, we can push that even harder.,1,1\n",
      "So, that's the context for it.,1,1\n",
      "It's really just making sure that as EE is integrated into BT, we can really leverage the capability across all lines of business.,1,1\n",

      "The BT brand comes from a household heritage.,1,1\n",
      "As we add mobile, it comes largely to increasing the capability around broadband outside of the home, and that's the heartland of where our growth is coming from there.,1,1\n",

      "And then just following up on the Consumer side, can you just help add a bit more color on that sort of change in consumer lines?,1,1\n",
      "I mean, that seems a bit of a watershed moment for you and just what's driven that.,1,1\n",
      "Is it the fact that sort of the inactive base is so small now?,1,1\n",
      "Is it the vast majority of BT customers now have a broadband connection?,1,1\n",
      "So going forward, you'd expect that line base to keep growing.,1,1\n",
      "Just sort of a bit of intelligence as to how you turn that to growth would be great.,3,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Tony, do you want to talk about the outlook and maybe John, do you want to talk about how you see the lines position changing?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Okay.,1,1\n",
      "You wouldn't expect me to fine tune the growth so shortly after giving our outlook number.,3,1\n",
      "So, the 1% to 2% range stays as is.,1,1\n",
      "But there's maybe - we're just clarifying a few points, which I raised when I talked about the results of the outlook.,1,1\n",
      "The first is that we are anniversarying out the ladder pricing.,1,1\n",
      "The second is there is the timing on the consumer price increases.,1,1\n",
      "And thirdly, the Global Services had a number of one-offs in Q3.,1,1\n",
      "We also got a tough comparison in terms of Q4.,1,2\n",
      "So I think you need to look all those three things in conjunction to look at the movement between Q3 and Q4.,1,1\n",
      "A: John, in terms of the improvement on consumer lines.,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the lines, I think the key point is not so much the number in a given quarter, it's the trend.,1,1\n",
      "And the trend has been consistently getting better on this for a long period of time.,2,1\n",
      "There wasn't particular factors that drove the performance this quarter.,1,1\n",
      "I would point to the strong broadband performance, first of all, the Champions League, there's been a lot of commentary on TalkTalk and I'm not going to add to that but it's kind of widely known that they have stopped selling on their website for a period of time, in effect, ceased trading, so that's bound to have had some effect on the marketplace as well.,2,1\n",
      "So, several factors behind it.,1,1\n",
      "We're certainly not, sort of, guaranteeing growth on a go-forward basis because there were one off factors here.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Next, please.,3,1\n",

      "Q: Hey.,1,1\n",
      "Good morning, Gavin.,3,1\n",
      "Just a couple of questions.,1,1\n",
      "One on Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "Maybe slightly directed on your strategic options or your strategic outlook for that business given it is a separate ex-UK unit now.,1,1\n",
      "Is it more sellable?,1,1\n",
      "And is it core or non-core to your business going forward?,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, just on the G.FAST and the trials you've been conducting, I wondered if you could give us any kind of real-world examples on the speed you're being able to deliver at a certain distance of cabinet or however you wish to measure it.,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, I'm going to ask Howard to probably talk about G.FAST.,1,1\n",
      "It's Howards's - it's his first day at school.,1,1\n",
      "Today, he's the CEO of TSO.,1,1\n",
      "So, I'll give him a chance to answer what we're learning about G.FAST.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of GS, let me be very clear.,1,1\n",
      "First of all, it isn't ex-UK.,1,1\n",
      "It includes multinational business particularly our financial services customers that are headquartered out of the UK.,1,1\n",
      "So, this is about companies who are multinationals, who have got operations in multiple countries, be those headquarters in the UK or Italy or Germany or the US So, it is really just a - it's focused around a certain type of customers, it's not just about geography.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of our commitment, we're absolutely committed to Global Services.,1,1\n",
      "It is a business that is continuing to improve quarter-on-quarter.,2,1\n",
      "As I mentioned in my rundown by line of business, some of these numbers are the best for a number of years, particularly on free cash flow being generated out of the business.,2,1\n",
      "And we see the mix of the order book continuing to improve as we win more business from our competitors.,2,1\n",
      "So, we feel as though this is a business that's primed to grow.,1,1\n"

      "But, Luis, do you want to give some color on that?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I think though that looking to what has been the main drivers of improvement in the UK, I think, that if you look to the current scope on government, I think that we'll have signed and extended the services for 26,000 agents in the Department of Work and Pension.,2,1\n",
      "That is a very good deal.,4,1\n",
      "We have been able to consolidate as well in some of the regional services like [indiscernible] has done in other areas.,2,1\n",
      "On the corporate sector, the extension of the services like, in the financial services area, with Nationwide, this is what is helping us to really drive the underlying improvement on the current scope of GS in the UK.,2,1\n",
      "When we look ahead, in line with what you've said, Gavin, I think the ability to provide service to companies that are going more and more global have worked in the UK.,1,1\n",
      "I think that even traditional customers of BT like Unilever or in new players in the market that have really continued to expand their business.,2,1\n",
      "I think there is a major opportunity for us to support those businesses.,2,1\n",
      "And we can really leverage the value of the success of the things we have been able to sign all around the globe.,3,1\n",
      "And I think cyber security is a good example of where we are signing incremental set of deals or collaboration.,3,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "And then the second question was around the digital communications review, I think.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the timing, I think it's probably best to ask Ofcom.,2,1\n",
      "It was meant to be January.,1,1\n",

      "So, two lots , please.,3,1\n",
      "The first one is now that you have EE, can you be a little bit more specific about the size of the - specifically the business Mobile segment?,1,1\n",
      "So, how big is it in terms of revenue?,1,1\n",
      "And what sort of market share does EE have today?,1,1\n",
      "So, I'm not asking for a forecast, but what market share does EE have of that today.,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, within BT Business, at what point should we or how soon should we hope to see success in fixed mobile bundles starting to have a positive impact on the revenue trends of BT Business?,3,1\n",
      "And maybe you can talk about why it hasn't really had an impact or a perceptible impact to-date, please.,3,1\n",
      "A: Sure, well, I'm not going to give you any of the specifics around share of EE in the Business market today.,1,1\n",
      "We will give more color on our strategy going forwards.,1,1\n",
      "As I mentioned in the presentation, we're going to do an Investor Day at the same time as our Q4 results.,1,1\n",
      "And at that point, we will give more detail on how we see the strategy working going forwards.,1,1\n",
      "But I want to keep you interested, so we will save some of the detail until then.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the Business market itself, one of the things we found very attractive about EE was that it had a fantastic position in 4G, but it wasn't going to create a huge cannibalization effect in the business market for us because it was relatively underdeveloped versus Vodafone and O2.,3,2\n",
      "So, we saw it as a source of revenue opportunity when it's combined with BT Businesses' reach in terms of its customer base and expertise in terms of IP.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think we're very well placed to cease that opportunity.,1,1\n",
      "And perhaps, Graham, you'd just like to just to add some comments to that.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "Just a couple of comments.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, in terms of fixed mobile convergence, it's worth just understanding the context for the last nine months.,1,1\n",
      "We've obviously been through a period where we've had to migrate all our business mobile customers and from the Vodafone MVNO to the EE MVNO, and that completed towards the end of October.,1,1\n",
      "So, that was a challenging period for the business as we went through the migration.,1,1\n",
      "I guess coming out of the backend of that, now, we're beginning to see reasonably strong RGU growth in our mobile services from that point.,1,1\n",
      "And as we look at EE business coming in into the large line of business in April 1, we're pretty confident that that we can deliver the revenue synergies that have been committed.,3,1\n",
      "A: And one just, one fact to give you a little bit of a sense of the opportunity, John.,1,1\n",
      "If we look at our top 500 BT accounts or Business accounts, they have less than 3% of EE's revenue in them.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think it gives you an indication of the complementary nature of the EE versus BT.,1,1\n",

      "Thanks very much.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, with respect to the first question, we're going to give you an update on EE's quarter four in a couple of weeks' time.,3,1\n",
      "So, you'll see how they ended the year.,1,1\n",
      "And of course, from next quarter's results, they will be fully integrated.,1,1\n",
      "So, I want to keep you interested until then next.,2,1\n",
      "So, I won't be giving you any more detail today.,1,1\n",
      "And then on the question on capital employed in Openreach around GEA, Tony?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "So, from the annual report, you'll see that the CapEx is roundabout 300 million to 400 million, and we're running at the same sort of rate this year.,1,2\n",
      "Q: Overall capital that's been spent over five years is about 1.5 billion on that product?,1,1\n",

      "I know they've only rolled out a couple of hundred thousand homes so far, but any indications of competition in those areas that you're seeing would be much appreciated.,2,1\n",

      "A: ...our appetite for commercial relationship?,1,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "So, we were very surprised by this finding because the substance of the finding seems to be that Sky is dominant because they comprise more than 70% of the revenues in the sector, so they have unique bidding advantage in the acquisition of sports rights.,1,1\n",
      "Further, that they have both the ability and incentive to not supply those same rights to the marketplace.,1,1\n",
      "But despite those conclusions that basically say there is potential market problem, they then conclude and we think for the moment there is no need for regulation.,1,2\n",
      "Although, they did promise to keep this under review, and should they see a problem emerging, they promised to step in.,2,2\n",
      "So, we think it's a very surprising conclusion and a very sort of hard-to-fathom sequence of logics.,1,1\n",
      "Our plan is to appeal this basically.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of our appetite for a commercial deal, the appetite - the wholesale access to Sky Sports has always been there, and the difficulty has been to secure such a deal on terms that make sense for our business.,2,2\n",
      "We haven't seen any sign of a change in attitude from Sky.,1,1\n",
      "And therefore, there is a need for the regulator to step in to solve this problem for consumers.,1,2\n",

      "Now, we know that this thing could change potentially, but right now it's having a minimal impact.,1,1\n",

      "Are you able to give any indication in terms of the timing on that WMO appeal is heard, please?,3,1\n",

      "The step change in BT net adds - BT TV net adds that you reported last quarter has been sustained this quarter.,1,1\n",
      "Do you think that run rate is sustainable?,1,1\n",
      "And I suppose what I'm interested in is whether you're getting better at selling TV into the base, whether it's direct or above the line marketing working better, or do you think BT is getting more broad recognition as a TV provider?,2,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: John.,1,1\n",
      "A: I think the proposition has been strengthened from the acquisition of the Champions League.,1,1\n",
      "And so, what we've seen as of two strong quarters really driven by that, I'm very hesitant to give any sort of forward-looking projections of net additions because not only as we continue to face significant headwinds in the sector, really given by the challenge of competing versus such a dominant provider in the form of Sky who still refuses to wholesale their content to us.,1,2\n",
      "So, this remains a challenging market for us.,1,1\n",
      "I would say that there is actually quite a big opportunity there for us because the proportion of our customers that have TV is much lower than you find for our competitors.,1,1\n",
      "Only about 15% of our customers take triple-play from us.,1,1\n",
      "If you look at Virgin, that figure is around 90%, for example.,1,1\n",

      "And secondly, a question to Gavin, really.,1,1\n",
      "Are you slightly fearful in the UK mobile base that Hutchison and Three UK do whatever it takes to get their deal done with O2, and therefore, we have more people entering the UK mobile market rather than less.,1,2\n",

      "Clearly, we would be extremely disappointed if we had not moved to that as we moved into the 2018/2019 year.,1,5\n",

      "It's been going on since 2008.,1,1\n",
      "And when you actually look at our business, I mean, obviously it's pretty shocking when you look at the EBITDA decline in public sector as a whole.,3,3\n",
      "But 90% of that decline in the year is due to the six contracts that we've discussed.,1,2\n",
      "So, the reason we're confident about the regional agenda going forward is if you look at the rest of our business, SME and corporate, it's founded on - and with the integration of EE that's really strengthened it - it's founded on strong distribution and scale, which really which is unparalleled, actually, in the UK market.,2,1\n",
      "And as you can see from those segments, we're growing profitability well, 5% year-to-date.,2,1\n",
      "So, we have already been working on strengthening our regional public sector team.,1,1\n",
      "We've been doing that over the last six months.,1,1\n",
      "We changed out the bulk of our public sector management team in Q1.,1,1\n",
      "So, we have been working on strengthening distribution.,1,1\n",
      "But the reason we're confident that we can move this forward is that we actually are doing this already in the other segments and doing it well and are the market leader.,2,1\n",
      "And what you will see as this moves forward, is that the shape of the business will change to be more predictable with less profit spikes due to the fact that the implementation of a much more standardized model with very strong distribution is really where we're trying to take the business.,2,1\n",

      "Look, in terms of the technology, what is clear is with NGA1, there is still significant demand across the business.,1,1\n",
      "So I mean that's illustrated I think by the record number of net adds that Openreach have posted this quarter, almost 0.5 million, 27% take-up of homes passed, and that's a pretty strong result.,3,1\n",
      "We're not resting on that.,1,1\n",
      "We've already started gearing up on NGA2, and NGA2 for us is a mixture of technologies.,1,1\n",
      "Yes, there's G.fast, which gives us speed and scale quickly at price points that we know customers want.,1,1\n",
      "But at the same time, we share the government's view that over the long term, that FTTP will be more of our network going forwards, and we will continue to build our FTTP footprint.,1,1\n",

      "We have the production hardware.,1,1\n",
      "We have the production firmware and we're building a footprint quite quickly now.,1,1\n",
      "The first pilot customers, the indications are the performance of the product over the new equipment is pretty much spot on what we had predicted from the labs and the earlier field trials and I'm very pleased with that.,4,1\n",
      "So, I'm very pleased with where we stand right now on G.fast.,4,1\n",
      "We spent a lot of time this year honing our techniques for delivering FTTP.,1,1\n",
      "And the challenge for Openreach is to show that we can hit lower cost points than have historically been thought possible.,1,2\n",
      "The more we can do that, the more we can consider adjusting the mix in the 10 million of G.fast and 2 million of FTTP.,1,1\n",
      "We're learning all the time on FTTP.,1,1\n",
      "We are attaching more customers, selling more services on our existing FTTP footprint than ever before.,1,1\n",
      "And we are working very hard to hone the customer experience of provisioning on that FTTP platform.,1,1\n",
      "So, we're very focused on improving every aspect of our FTTP delivery, customer experience and cost.,2,1\n",
      "And if we can do that, then we can look forward to, over time, justifying raising the FTTP delivery schedule.,1,1\n",
      "A: And CapEx?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well finally, on CapEx, the outlook reflects the existing investment plans that we laid out earlier this year.,1,1\n",
      "That comprises, includes the NGA2 program of G.fast and FTTP that we'd set out earlier this year.,1,1\n",
      "And that, as Gavin and Clive described, we see that as a program that we can flex between different technologies as we move forward.,1,1\n",

      "There's another couple that continue to run out during the course of next year.,1,1\n",
      "And at that point, that sort of - the completion of those contracts has largely come out of the base, and we can then, as Graham described, sort of build from there.,1,1\n",

      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",

      "It's worth noting that we have re-signed and renewed the bulk of those over the last 12 months.,1,1\n",
      "So, we're entering a period where we don't have many major contracts up for renewal during the period of when we cycle out the large public sector contracts.,1,1\n",
      "A: So, I think, hopefully, as you can hear from that, this has been a particular challenge for us in this current year and flows through into next.,1,2\n",

      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",

      "But the Ofcom case, so they're going forward, there'll be a strict regime of keeping tabs on the market to look at future changes and implications for competition.,1,2\n",

      "In the last quarter, we also launched Family SIM in the consumer space, which allows you to get multiple SIMs at increasing discounts, which works extremely well for big families, and there are a few of those in the room, I think.,1,1\n",

      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",

      "So, if we were able to unwind all of those transactions by the end of December, you'd have seen probably something like another 200 million or so impact in the net debt.,2,1\n",
      "That's the sort of order that that would have had.,1,1\n",
      "The other component in terms of the EBITDA guidance is clearly the impact in the year-to-date, but it's also then the lower trading for the remainder of the year.,1,1\n",

      "I think Graham's going to pick up on public sector.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I'll just give you a little bit more depth on the contract position.,1,1\n",
      "So, when we look at these six contracts, they've either been lost, partially lost or the services have been discontinued.,1,1\n",
      "This is a multiyear issue, and I'll just go through it in a moment.,1,1\n",
      "So, three of those six contracts were exited in 2015-2016, including all attributable costs.,1,1\n",
      "So, I defer run rate in this year.,1,1\n",
      "One was partially lost, which was the network component, and the majority of their remaining services we retained but at lower margins.,1,1\n",
      "One is being disaggregated and subject to market competition, and we hope to retain some of that but at lower margins.,3,1\n",
      "And one contract has been split in two.,1,1\n",
      "The network component has been lost and some other services have been retained at lower margins.,1,1\n",
      "This is our largest contract.,1,1\n",
      "And the network is subject to a multiyear complex migration of all the components and services of which that is in progress and will come out over the next 18 months.,3,1\n",
      "So, it's a complex situation where decisions made between 2013 and 2016 and the actual physical movement of some of this can take years to complete.,1,1\n",
      "And these are effectively large bespoked contracts, and the government has been moving and is moving very much to frameworks and purchasing of services, and hence, the strengthening of the regional agenda, getting our product and portfolio framework ready across the board so that we can use the scale of our distribution to drive that through.,1,1\n",

      "Good morning.,3,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "I've got two quick ones.,1,1\n",
      "The first one is I wonder what more Simon can say to those who are whispering that the dividend cover is actually quite tight over the next couple of years.,1,1\n",
      "I wonder, as part of that, whether I can, first of all, confirm that in fiscal 2018 you've got about 200 million of exceptional CapEx still there, 100 million ESN, 100 million EE integration, and that should actually fall out in fiscal 2019.,4,1\n",
      "And also, it would be nice to figure out, although I know you will repurpose this for G.fast and FTTP, it would be nice to figure out what the run rate CapEx is for FTTC which is coming to an end, I suspect, by the end of this calendar year.,3,2\n",
      "And then, secondly, at Christmastime, Marc kindly told us that mobile customers are taking to content and BT Sports.,2,1\n",
      "I asked them at the time whether this is anything more than a gimmick and therefore this is going to be - if it isn't a gimmick, how important a consideration will be - will that be for you, Gavin and Simon, when you next come to bid for content going forward.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: I think that's four questions, but we'll let you off because there's some quick ones.,1,1\n",
      "Simon, on dividend, CapEx and FTTC runway.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "A: And Marc on content on mobile.,1,1\n",
      "A: So, dealing with the three questions, start with the two CapEx ones.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly, you are correct that there is continuing ESN investment and EE integration investment in 2017-2018 and that those elements in the investment plan clearly flow out as then we move into 2018 and 2019.,1,1\n"

      "So, your understanding on that is correct.,1,1\n",
      "Secondly, on the FTTC, we have within - as I mentioned earlier, our CapEx - our outlook is based upon our existing investment plans.,1,1\n",
      "That did see the NGA program, NGA1 program, obviously, sort of ramping down, but it did include the first phases of the NGA2 program in 2017-2018.,1,1\n",
      "And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive that program and to look at delivering it ever more productively.,1,1\n",
      "But that is based into our existing - the existing investment plan is based on the outlook.,1,1\n",
      "And then finally, on the dividend, clearly, we've reiterated our outlook for at least 10% growth into EPS for this year and the next.,1,1\n",
      "This does take full account of the lower EBITDA and a normalized free cash flow outlook for 2017-2018.,1,1\n",
      "And we see buffer built into our plans in order to underpin those dividend commitments.,1,1\n",
      "A: Very good.,4,1\n",
      "Content on mobile?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, a year ago, the new EE team set out with the belief that the more for more strategy would deliver revenue growth.,1,1\n",
      "And more for more is about the belief that having the best network in the UK with 100% service and better experience for our customers, along with great execution of our pricing discipline, as well as content, would turn around the revenue performance.,3,1\n",
      "So, you can see the results on the revenue performance.,1,1\n",
      "Content isn't the only part of it, but it is an important component of it.,1,1\n",
      "Sports is one element and music with our partnership with Apple is another.,1,1\n",
      "So, it's part of a package that is increasing consideration and helping our revenue performance turn around.,1,1\n",
      "Q: I'm trying to figure out whether you can bid more for content because you feel confident that you can defrag some of that costs through mobile.,2,1\n",
      "That's what I'm trying to figure out.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I think it's early days.,1,1\n",
      "What is interesting I think is that people are using the service and several 100,000 customers have signed up for it.,2,1\n",
      "We haven't really entered the charging period yet because it was - there was a free period at the beginning of the launch.,1,1\n",
      "But if you look at the usage stats, they're clearly watching it, and I think it will be interesting to see how many we retain when they get charged for it.,2,2\n",
      "But it's clearly - if you look to the US, the acquisition of AT&T and Time Warner, that is driven fundamentally by content across mobile.,1,1\n",
      "That is cited as the reason for doing it.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think it is a developing area.,1,1\n",
      "I think it strengthens our ability to bid, but I'm not going to go into the details of what that looks like.,2,1\n",

      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "On the second one first, I mean I think a bigger problem is not so much our capital employed going down because actually there'll be a lot of expenditures in things like fiber.,2,2\n",
      "It seems that some of the decisions don't recognize some of the capital employed we've actually got.,1,1\n",
      "That's more of a challenge.,1,2\n",
      "Actually, fiber - bear in mind that fiber is not regulated.,1,1\n",
      "Ofcom made it quite clear that they looked at the net debt before we started the fiber rollout, that they weren't seeking to regulate it, particularly on the grounds of the fact that they saw copper as an alternative, and they didn't feel it should be regulated.,1,1\n",
      "And, I mean to be honest, actually, if it was, given, if you take the sort of cost of capital returns criteria, probably the prices will be a lot higher than they are today.,1,1\n",
      "And so from that point of view, it's always a challenge to having a regulated business, if you take the prices down, if you become more and more efficient, at some point some bits of that comes back to - the regulator looks at that, and maybe to a degree, some of the price changes that we - cost changes we've seen reflects some area of that, but then, Olivia, if you want to add anything to that?,1,2\n",

      "And clearly that's critical.,1,2\n",
      "But, yeah, we absolutely - there is a asymmetry and that's frankly why we've gone to court, and we await the court decision, but we absolutely want to be a customer of Sky in the same way that Sky are a big customer of ours, and that would seem in a converging world absolutely the right outcome.,1,1\n",
      "Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Follow up, if you think fiber will be regulated and if so when that might be?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, I think I said Ofcom looked really carefully at this and they were very clear as to why not and I don't hear any sign from Ofcom that they think that was a bad decision and they made it very clear that they see copper as an alternative methodology.,1,2\n",

      "A: Sure, in terms of the first question, I think it's good to look at BT overall, three years ago we were on the fourth quartile in terms of benchmarking within the telecom sector.,3,1\n",
      "We're now at the bottom of the second quartile.,1,1\n",
      "Inherent within certain activities, if you look at what we're doing in terms of IT and network operations, we're in the third, fourth quartiles.,1,1\n",
      "So there's plenty of opportunity there.,1,1\n",
      "Now our focus very much, if you say where we are in retail and not that I'm talking about discussing Gavin's budgets and targets next year, but he's got hundreds of millions of pounds of savings that he needs to do next year.,1,1\n",
      "The other - I can see he's delighted by that.,3,1\n",
      "And - but, what I was saying is within the other lines of business, we're at different stages of the evolution cycle and we've got plenty of opportunities there, both in terms of these generic processes that go across BT as well as specific activities within the lines of business.,1,1\n",
      "We're not short of opportunities.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the Olympics, look, we're going to incur more costs this year than we did last year.,1,1\n",

      "First of all, just on retail pricing, I mean I guess we've seen sort of general modest inflation and things like line rental for the last two or three years, but that to a degree has been supported by general modest inflation of wholesale prices that actually disappears this year and next.,2,2\n",
      "So how do we think about the retail pricing environment on the back of lower wholesale prices?,1,1\n",
      "And then secondly, for Tony, just on your sort of points on liquidity and debt, I guess you've given very clear guidance on cash flow dividends and buybacks and you can do the math and at the bottom appears about 2.3 billion, 2.4 billion of surplus cash, to use one phrase over the next couple of years.,1,1\n",
      "Do we assume that that's used primarily to pay down debt, certainly one way of sorting out your interests is retiring debt, not borrowing money at a higher rate than the average rate.,2,1\n",

      "Gavin, do you want to talk about pricing?,1,1\n",
      "You got some great deals for Steve out there?,2,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, of course.,1,1\n",
      "I mean you're right to observe.,1,1\n",
      "It's a very price sensitive market at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "There's no question about that.,1,1\n",
      "And we've seen a number of our competitors go very aggressively in the last quarter really chasing volume, and we're not necessarily going to follow that where it's uneconomic.,1,4\n",
      "So it will I think be - it will move around a little bit.,1,1\n",
      "More generally in terms of the scope to drive pricing more strategically, should I say, we do see inflation coming down and I think that provides less of an umbrella.,1,2\n",
      "And we have made a commitment at the same time to hold our prices until 2013.,1,1\n",
      "And I think we're seeing the benefits of that come through in more stable operations, better value for money stores, high satisfaction.,2,2\n",
      "So I think that was the right thing to do.,1,1\n",
      "Beyond that, I think the answer for us really lies in bundling.,1,4\n",

      "A: I think that might be for Tony rather than Liv what you're expecting.,1,1\n",
      "On broadband, I think the UK is actually the most - one of the most connected societies anywhere in the world as much as some newspapers like to sort of do the UK down all the time.,2,1\n",
      "If you look, there is a recent survey from McKinsey, I think it was BCG, that had the UK as the Internet was the largest proportion of the economy in the UK, in the world, beating places like Sweden and South Korea.,2,1\n",
      "And, but the reason, and so, people are using it particularly for ecommerce a lot in the UK.,1,1\n",
      "And also, pricing is really effective.,1,1\n",
      "If you just open any newspaper, the degree of advertising is immense and thirdly we're offering more and better and I think the fiber is part of that.,2,1\n",

      "A: One more thing we should say about - Jeff, I think this is also we'll be pushing for because people have talked a lot about regulations in the UK, we would wish regulation around the world to be regulation in the UK, and certainly one of the areas where we'll be pushing very hard, and I think the US is absolutely high on our list, and we spent a lot of time with the FCC and the coalition of partners, and no choke alliance, that that really cost should come down in a lot of these areas.,1,4\n",

      "So do the economics for the BT Group work without a successful wholesale product?,3,1\n",
      "And secondly, a question for Gavin on BT Vision, can you just give us a breakdown of what people are actually doing currently with BT Vision?,1,2\n",
      "I mean how many are watching premium channels or what actually is the consumer doing?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: No.,1,1\n",
      "We're not subsidizing Infinity.,1,1\n",
      "Actually, we got a good ARPU uplift with Infinity.,3,1\n",
      "It's one of the - people are get a little bit confused between how we market the product, because very clearly we set the prices linked to our option two and three broadband.,1,1\n",
      "Understand, we've actually got three levels of broadband option one.,1,1\n",
      "We don't have an option one Infinity as it were equivalent, it's called Option One bit.,1,1\n",
      "It's priced as the same as option two broadband.,1,1\n",
      "So you get a really good mix change quite apart from the fact we expect to have significantly lower churn from Infinity.,4,1\n",
      "So it's - now we're making - we will make good money at on Infinity at retail levels.,3,1\n",
      "No question about that.,1,1\n",
      "And the extra cost from Openreach, the vast majority before you get to the churn are actually covered by the higher ARPU that we achieve on Infinity.,1,1\n",
      "So I think the question is wrong from the start to be honest.,1,2\n",
      "But, Gavin , do you want to add anything - add anything to that and also what do people do with Vision?,1,1\n",
      "A: I'm not sure there's much data on the Infinity question.,1,1\n",
      "I think Ian's answered it.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of Vision it's a multitude of things, to be honest.,1,1\n",

      "Vodafone withdrew from the markets trying to sell broadband.,1,1\n",
      "O2 have just sold their base and which is a shame because they were a good contributor to market share adds.,3,3\n",

      "There are packages - if you put things together.,1,1\n",

      "What do you think the underlying price cut is because obviously the headline [indiscernible],1,1\n",

      "And second question, I was wondering if I could push you a bit more on your thoughts on the Fixed Access Review that is coming up and I'm assuming some of the slides coming later.,1,1\n",
      "You talked about the 8 to 10 recommendation from the European Union on copper pricing.,1,1\n",
      "Is that aligned with your kind of thinking of what you're planning for?,2,1\n",

      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: No, we're not expecting a change.,1,1\n",
      "I think it would be pretty dumb of us to tell you what we had in mind about the potential outcome for next set of reviews.,3,2\n",
      "I think what is quite clear is the UK is more by European standards and I think some other places in Europe are saying, well, actually we should start looking at inflation and prices going up.,1,2\n",
      "But I won't talk about what's incorporated in our plans and contingencies we've got, but we'll be arguing very strongly, I think, to reflect the fact that particularly given more difficult weather conditions and things like that as to why prices - why there's actually a need to recognize that in inflation.,2,2\n",
      "In terms of cost transformation, we said on quite regular basis that some parts of our business were, shall we say, more involved in terms of cost transformation.,1,1\n",
      "We've been at it for longer.,1,1\n",
      "I think in this particular restructuring, probably two areas that will have the biggest change are going to be in TSO, which Clive Selley will talk about.,1,1\n",
      "We brought together our old operations division together with BT Innovate & Design and we think that will present some real opportunities and in the network that backs it up it's not - it's actually not just about people it's about network and simplifying it.,1,2\n",
      "But also we've also said that Global Services need to have a cost base consistent with a global leader, so you'll see that.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think, that'll be the two areas.,1,1\n",
      "But as the heads of all of the individual business units will tell you, they don't feel that their cost transformation program has finished yet.,1,1\n",
      "That I can absolutely assure you about.,1,1\n",

      "So in terms of share of voice, certainly it was around about the number that we typically get, which is about 20% share of voice.,1,1\n",
      "John, is there anything I've missed?,1,2\n",
      "A: Yeah, just two comments.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly, in quarter four, the cost of media is typically down anyway versus previous quarters.,1,1\n",
      "That's just seasonality.,1,1\n",
      "It's typically about 17% cheaper in quarter four.,1,2\n",
      "Secondly, Sky's spend on above the line might have down and perhaps relatively marginally versus previous periods, but it was still about 100% higher than ours.,1,1\n",

      "Can you just clarify that the costs of the mobile launches are indeed, included in the guidance you've given today?,1,1\n",
      "And can you perhaps give us some sense of what investments will be required in mobile this year?,1,1\n",
      "And then I do have a follow-up on mobile as well.,1,1\n",
      "A: Do you want to answer that, Tony?,1,1\n",
      "The question was, are the investments in mobile included in our outlook?,1,1\n",
      "The answer is yes for that.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "A: I mean in terms of the scale of the investments.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, what I'd say here is that if you look at our outlook, another thing.,1,1\n",
      "We've got our base investment in mobile incurred in there.,1,1\n",
      "If we have to make something incremental on top of that, we'll change our outlook, but we'll change our outlook both in terms of revenues and profits, as well as investments.,2,1\n",
      "And we'll outline what we're doing much as we did with Sport to say, this is what we're putting in.,1,1\n",
      "This is the consequential impact.,1,1\n",
      "This is the gain that we'll get from that.,1,1\n",
      "Q: And just a follow-up on the mobile side.,1,1\n",
      "Is it right that you're going to struggle to be competitive on roaming costs for the enterprise segment, given you're not part of a roaming group, seems to be the feedback that I'm getting.,1,3\n",

      "We'll supplement that in time with access to our own spectrum and access our Wi-Fi hotspots.,1,1\n",

      "It's not about simply doing me-too vanilla-type deals.,1,1\n",
      "So, I'm very confident we're going to be competitive.,3,1\n",

      "On the Global Services order book, is it about -- mostly about your entering new markets and having a good push there or is there any sign of life for the existing customer base, any particular product that's picking up or any particular customer segment within the total enterprise, which is picking up with the economy perhaps?,3,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: Luis, do you want to talk a little bit about the order book.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I think that the results of the order intake has been quite well balanced across the business.,1,1\n",
      "The good thing is that we have got probably the best in class in the industry in terms of longer-term deals.,3,1\n",
      "So, we have signed only probably more than five or six large deals of above six years which is probably nothing that is happening across the industry that easily.,1,1\n",
      "We have secured Syngenta, which is a great example.,3,1\n",
      "It's a global deal, we have extended the services we were providing to them for another seven years.,1,1\n",
      "We have signed a new contract [indiscernible] , which is supporting Apple, EMC, HP manufacturing and is a US deal, but it's also an Asia-Pac because we have a large China roll-out.,2,1\n",
      "And we have been able to secure a number of companies, like Rexel, where we have 1,200 sites all across Europe, one of the leading players.,2,1\n",
      "We have been able secure some new pharma companies like Almirall, which is also a European one, Indesit in Italy, Prysmian is the leading cable operator, but also in Latin America with Nutresa, which is a new multi-Latinas regional player.,2,1\n",
      "So I think it is well-balanced.,1,1\n",
      "And in terms of portfolio, it's the same thing, right.,1,1\n",
      "Some of these deals, like the one of [indiscernible] which is in 112 sites across 25 countries.,2,1\n",
      "They have a network, infrastructure.,1,1\n",
      "They have also the interconnection of the data centers.,1,1\n",
      "They have the voice services on top, the conferencing services and the security wrapped around that.,2,1\n",
      "So it's a well-balanced portfolio which de-risk and, at the same time, shows the opportunity that Gavin referred to about the growth chances we have.,1,2\n",

      "I mean, Virgin's marketing exactly double your top speed of 152 megabits per second.,1,1\n",
      "Your capital spend is actually falling every year.,1,1\n",
      "I think Openreach is down 8% year.,1,1\n",
      "And I guess within your overall CapEx you've got 1 billion of capitalized labor as well.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, is it realistic to wait two years for G.fast?,1,1\n",
      "And what's really the difference in costs between G.fast and going all the way into the home?,1,1\n",
      "It seems like its a few tens of meters difference so I'm not sure what the difference is between going to fibre-to-the-home now and waiting for a new standard G.fast.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, if you look at our results, clearly there is a demand for our fibre cabinet-based services.,1,1\n",
      "No question about that.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the take-up, it's the fastest take-up certainly across Europe.,1,1\n",
      "We had our best-ever quarter in these numbers.,2,1\n",
      "And it's not just across the BT branded services.,1,1\n",
      "It's - our other service provider's picking it up as well.,1,1\n",
      "So, it's clearly got demand.,1,1\n",
      "There's no question about that.,1,1\n",
      "We can see an ability to get more speed through things like vectoring and if we need - or, indeed, customers are looking for further speed on top of that, we can deliver fibre to the premise on demand out of any of the cabinets that are served with FTTC and that will be complete across the year as a whole.,2,1\n",
      "So, I think we're well-placed to respond to the market and to do so in a very capital-efficient way.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the results, Virgin, I think, announced 40,000 ads in the quarter across all service providers including BT.,1,1\n",
      "We added, I think, 357, I think, fibre ads this quarter.,1,1\n",
      "So, I think, you can - the numbers, I think, make a very strong case on their own.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Am I allowed one more?,1,1\n",
      "A: No.,1,1\n",
      "Next?,1,1\n",

      "Also when are you going to have automatic authentication on the Wi-Fi built into your handsets and you're playing two things like voice over Wi-Fi, as well, within the network.,2,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Well, in terms of what we can capture, I mean, there are several studies that demonstrate the majority of certainly data usage on mobile is within the premise.,1,2\n",
      "I think 70% is the number that's often quoted.,1,1\n",
      "And if you look at the extensive network that we have across a Wi-Fi base, both inside and outside the home, we'll be able to access our 4G spectrum because we're going to build into the hub a cell that's able to automatically switch over to our spectrum when you're close to it.,1,1\n",
      "So, we think we're going to get the majority of people's usage onto our network, and where we can't, they'll be able to roam seamlessly onto the arrangement we've got with EE.,2,1\n",
      "So I think it's going to be pretty cost effective.,3,1\n",
      "It's going to allow us to do some pretty compelling propositions, we think.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the timeframe, the critical thing we've got to get to get right is the customer experience.,1,2\n",
      "And the customer experience requires that the cells are able to self-organize, and that is the piece that we're developing at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "We are very confident we will be able to make that work, and that is the key technology step to get right.,3,1\n",
      "Q: Voice-over-Wi-Fi at all?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean it will be voice and data over the best available network, the right network that's available.,2,1\n",

      "Or, again, is this proven technology how you amalgam all these things together?,1,1\n",

      "So if you imagine a street of houses, we would like to have Femtocells in many of them.,1,1\n",
      "We've got to organize the cells, or inside of the cell the technology's got to be able to adapt to the proximity of other cells in order that they don't interfere.,1,1\n",
      "So that's the technical problem that we have to crack and we're working with the key vendors, including the chipset vendors, to solve that issue.,1,2\n",
      "And what I would say is, we're getting very full attention from the vendors, because they see small cells as being much more important in a 4G world than in a 3G world, so there is a lot of R&D going-in, in the vendor community.,1,1\n",

      "But I think you're right that TalkTalk's second price increase in six months will clearly have left some of their customers scratching their heads as to have they bought a value brand or not.,2,1\n",
      "A: I think with Plusnet, and I referred to it in my presentation, Plusnet is much broader than simply a Consumer brand.,1,1\n",
      "Being able to create a business that is very lean and profitable but able to attract value and price-focused customers in the business market is also an opportunity for us and you'll see us continuing to focus on that.,2,1\n",

      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",
      "I don't know the number off the top of my head, do you have?,1,1\n",
      "Tony, has it.,1,1\n",
      "A: The guidance we've given is that Plusnet is round about 20% of our net adds or within that range.,1,1\n",
      "We gave about 15 months ago and what I'd say is it's coming in somewhat less than that 20% but certainly above the TalkTalk number.,1,1\n",
      "A: Yes?,1,1\n",
      "Q: I'm surprised you haven't had a question on BT Sport yet, so I'll have a go.,1,1\n",
      "A: Okay.,1,1\n",
      "Q: I mean, Tony, you made some comments I saw on an interview this morning that you've had some discussions with Sky but have struggled to reach a potential price point on it, a wholesale agreement and if I look at your broadband net adds to what extent do you feel actually the offering you've got at the moment is good enough to help continue to drive growth in your broadband business or do you really feel that you do need to push on and get extra content to try to accelerate growth further?,3,3\n",
      "A: Look, in terms of BT Sport, we're very happy with the performance over the last 10 months.,3,1\n",
      "It's performed really well.,1,1\n",
      "To be able to get around 5 million customers in 10 months and to have the impact on our Consumer business that it's had, the impact on the way people look at us and perceive us as a brand is, I think, quite a remarkable achievement in that period.,2,1\n",
      "In terms of the series of rights that we've got, we think we've got a really good set of rights, particularly as you add rugby and Champions League football going forwards.,4,1\n",
      "So we will continue to strengthen the proposition and build on the programming, building on the interactive nature of the program going forwards.,1,1\n",
      "We are a willing wholesaler.,1,1\n",
      "We've demonstrated that.,1,1\n",
      "We've got a wholesale deal in place with Virgin, a wholesale deal in place with Setanta in Ireland.,1,1\n",
      "We wouldn't preclude doing one with Sky but there's a price that they think it's worth, there's a price that we think it's worth and there's a gap at the moment.,1,1\n",
      "In the meantime, we'll continue to drive our strategy because we still see this growth, and we can see the impact it's having on the business and we'll be financially disciplined about any additional rights that we add over and above that.,1,1\n",
      "Nick?,1,1\n",
      "Q: Just coming back to value concepts that John mentioned, within BT's own brand you've obviously put through a big price increase on line rental and also started to charge for 1571, so 15% increase, I think, in line rentals altogether.,2,2\n",
      "How many people are...?,1,1\n",
      "A: 3.5%.,1,1\n",
      "Check your numbers.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Which one, for line rental?,1,1\n",
      "A: For line rental.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Plus voicemail, which used to be free.,1,1\n",
      "A: That's a different thing.,1,1\n",
      "You were saying 15% for line rental.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "So the line rental including voicemail has gone up 13%.,1,1\n",
      "But how many people are now opting out?,1,1\n",
      "And is that going to have a meaningful impact?,1,1\n",
      "Presumably on day one, 100% of people had it.,1,1\n",
      "How many people are leaving voicemail right now?,1,1\n",
      "A: Well, we don't break out the voicemail numbers in our KPIs.,1,1\n",
      "I think you get plenty of detail from our business.,1,1\n",
      "What I would say is, if you look at the performance of the Consumer business, if you look at the reduction in churn, you look at the reduction in line losses, you look at the share of broadband net adds, you can see the business is performing very well.,1,3\n",
      "So that's your answer.,1,1\n",
      "Robert?,1,1\n",
      "Q: Just looking at the Openreach net adds, very low number compared to the last three years, actually.,1,3\n",
      "Is any of that due to the weather or did that all wash out by the end of the quarter?,1,1\n",
      "A: Joe, do you want to just talk about the physical adds?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I think on - so we did go through a fairly exceptional period, which I think overall was well handled.,4,1\n",
      "But I think it is fair to say, there was an impact on the net adds that certainly pushed things back a reduced the overall number somewhat.,2,1\n",
      "A: Across the year, of course 83,000, which was consistent with last year.,1,1\n",
      "Yes, John?.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "On a three-to-five year view, how should we think about trends in depreciation and CapEx and depreciation relative to CapEx?,1,2\n",
      "A: Do you want to answer that?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, sure.,1,1\n",
      "The CapEx number will trend down slightly.,1,1\n",
      "But not going to be material.,1,1\n",
      "You're not going to get the 3.2% to 2.4% reduction.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of depreciation by default some of that will follow, but the lives of the asset base is changing.,1,2\n",
      "And their lives are somewhat shorter.,1,1\n",
      "So I see a slight trending down in terms of CapEx, a slight trending down in terms of depreciation.,1,2\n",
      "Q: Would you say the trending down from depreciation is slightly faster than the CapEx trending down?,1,2\n",
      "A: No, not necessarily.,1,1\n",

      "I think you said it was 14% penetration of fibre at the moment within Openreach.,1,1\n",
      "I think you talked before about a sort of 20%-type figure.,1,1\n",
      "Do we still think that's a - where it stops or can you talk about where you think it could be now?,1,1\n",
      "A: Look, we're not going to be setting goals in terms of fibre penetration.,1,1\n",
      "We're pleased with 14%.,3,1\n",
      "If you look at any international comparison, that's a good number.,3,1\n",
      "And if you look at some of the parts of the roll-out that have been in place the longest, we're over 20%.,1,1\n",
      "So Cornwall, where I was a couple of weeks ago, that was celebrating 20% adoption and that's about 90%-plus coverage now.,2,1\n",
      "So I think there is the potential to go further, but we're not guiding in terms of how that is and we'll continue to make sure that performing today and executing today is the priority.,1,1\n",
      "A: And it's just worth adding we've gone from 9% last year to 14% this year.,1,1\n",
      "A: Carl, I'm going to take two more after this.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Just in terms of the development of the entry level YouView box, up to now you've been very firm in terms of monetization of TV, requiring TV customers to actually pay you additional ARPU.,1,1\n",
      "I was just wondering if the development of a cheaper box does change your mindset slightly and whether you would consider monetization just through a longer contract period in terms of giving someone a free box, a free cheaper box.,1,2\n",
      "A: Two points on that.,1,1\n",
      "Firstly, we're not about to pre-announce our pricing for something that's being launched in several months' time.,1,1\n",
      "This does strengthen the overall economics.,1,1\n",
      "That's true.,2,1\n",
      "The service is already extremely cheap though, at just 5 a month, and I think our view is that a service that's completely free and that has a completely zero commitment from the customer is typically not valued by them either.,1,4\n"

      "A: Yes.,1,1\n",

      "So that's definitely a factor.,1,1\n",

      "So if I look at it in terms of the overall capital spend, it's broadly flat, within 20 million increase in the year.,1,1\n",
      "The own work capitalized in the year has gone up by about 148 million.,1,1\n",
      "And when you look at that increase, you've got to understand, it's actually gone up more in the second half of the year than the first half of the year.,1,1\n",
      "So the important point is the level of capitalization is probably the same.,1,1\n",
      "This mix of what is gain capitalized has changed.,1,1\n",
      "With the increase of the level of insourcing we do, the increased amount of BDUK activity we have, which is more complex, but I think the important point here is, the capital costs of that work gets shown, the growth costs get shown under own work capitalized.,1,1\n",
      "The rebate we get back from BDUK gets shown elsewhere.,1,1\n",
      "So, effectively, you've got an inflation in relation to the own work capitalized.,1,2\n",

      "In fact, we were already taking it very seriously.,1,1\n",
      "I think - the reason I think it will be challenging is, if I go back to my own experience in cable, cable built up its customer base in the 1990s franchise by franchise.,1,1\n",
      "When the deal was cheap phone calls versus BT, it was 25% saving versus BT, and throw in some analog TV at the same time, and they're up against an analog satellite proposition to Sky.,1,2\n",

      "It's nipped and tucked a little bit, but it hasn't had a huge change.,1,1\n",

      "So we're confident about what we're doing, why we're doing and the implications we're very engaged not just at, if you will, the technical level, but we're also engaged at the political level to ensure there's a clear understanding of what this is about, and we continue to invest.,2,1\n",

      "So I expect to see material savings both next year and the year after.,1,1\n",
      "In relation to the capital guidance, what I'm saying now is no different to what I said last quarter.,1,1\n",
      "We have - if you look at the run rate of where we are in terms of capital, broadly speaking that run rate will stay the same.,1,1\n",
      "It might oscillate a little bit year-on-year.,1,1\n",
      "If we choose to, for example, accelerate what we do in G.fast, some may come down, but it'll even itself out if I look over the period over the next five to six years.,1,1\n",

      "The other points are I think like just a packet loss, the overall quality of experience, and the marketing claims that we see from our competitors are very much just in terms of those top-line speeds.,2,3\n",
      "But I think you're quite right in saying that it's the overall experience that really counts.,1,1\n",
      "And that's what we're massively focused on optimizing and getting right for our customers.,1,1\n",
      "And so what we can see, it's taking a basket of measures and the service that we offer are significantly better.,2,1\n",

      "There's no reason why we should continue to be on the negative.,1,2\n",

      "I'm going to go to Nick.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Thanks very much.,1,1\n",
      "Just a few number checks, really.,1,1\n",
      "Obviously, on revenues, there's a slight miss against consensus, but EBITDA was a bit better, and you've got ladder pricing for 30 million, you've got the capitalization that we already talked about for about 100 million, you've also got more specific items, and I think historically, specific items were leaver costs rather were taken into EBITDA in 2012.,2,2\n",
      "I'm not sure when they went back out again.,1,1\n",
      "And you've got some copper sales as well.,1,1\n",
      "So if you add all that together, it's somewhere in excess of 200 million just for Q4 versus where consensus was.,1,2\n",
      "And then on another number, if you look at...,1,1\n",
      "A: Don't worry.,1,1\n",
      "We will answer that question, even though it wasn't a question.,1,1\n",
      "Q: And if I also look at the investments of 2.5 billion in fibre, if I take that off the Openreach CapEx for the last five or six years, which has been roughly flat that would imply that you should be earning 2.5 billion of EBITDA off a regulated utility with only about 500 million of CapEx.,1,2\n",

      "A: Tony?,1,1\n",
      "A: I'm sorry I didn't understand the first part in terms of the question.,1,2\n",
      "But in terms of the statement that you made and the accuracy of the statement you made, some points.,1,1\n",
      "So in the first instance, the level of copper rebate we've got in 2014/2015 in terms of recoveries was materially less than 2013/2014.,1,1\n",
      "The key point I think to understand is that the consensus number, like-for-like, we beat consensus by 50 million, ladder pricing was 30 million.,2,1\n",
      "Roughly speaking, 1% of the beat in the quarter was down to trading.,1,2\n",
      "So I don't see any issues in terms of that.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the leaver costs, the leaver cost payments that we have made in relation to the original guidance have been roundabout 100 million higher.,1,2\n",
      "The reason it's been a 100 million higher is we have let more people leave the company.,1,1\n",
      "The overall labor cost in the company are 4% less than they were last year.,1,1\n",
      "And what that means is that the throughput that we will get into this year allows us to be in a position to make an underlying growth of 3% after taking into account the fact that now we're going to be putting leaver cost above the line.,1,1\n",
      "But from an analyst perspective, what you've got hear is you've got 4% beat for next year in terms of our outlook.,1,1\n",
      "This should be clear, for 25 quarters, we've met or delivered or exceeded the outlook numbers in relation to our EBITDA.,1,1\n",
      "So you've got a 4% uplift in terms of cash growth, and we're also putting in 100 million or so above the line from below the line, which therefore should filter through into your numbers.,1,1\n",
      "Q: If I just follow up on the leaver costs because I think certainly in FY 2012 the leaver costs went back above the line.,1,1\n",
      "So when does that go below the line again?,1,1\n",
      "A: The leaver costs have been classified as part of the restructuring program since we've announced the restructuring program, which is going back a couple of years.,1,1\n",
      "I think the key point here is a number of you said, as far as leaver costs are concerned, show the leaver cost clearly, you might as well take it above the line and therefore you don't get involved in the discussions that we're having now about what's below and what's above.,1,2\n"

      "To give us some perspective on your guidance for gross cost savings, could you tell us how much gross cost reduction was achieved last year and the year before?,1,2\n",
      "And perhaps allied to that, perhaps you could just sort of highlight why, given the visibility that you say you've got on cost reduction, you weren't tempted to perhaps quantify an EBITDA target or perhaps a range for the 2017, 2018 year?,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: Tony, I know you'd be desperate to answer that one, so I'll let you have it.,1,3\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",

      "The trend in relation to gross cost transformation savings the last two years or three years compared to moving forward is not materially different.,1,2\n",
      "And I think it's - we'll go into more detail after the cost transformation session.,1,1\n",
      "And if we need further details, I suggest you have a follow-up on there.,1,1\n",
      "In relation to the EBITDA target, we felt you had a cash number in there and the cash number was pretty specific.,3,1\n",
      "The EBITDA follows through the cash because it's not going to be material movements from working capital.,1,1\n",
      "So, it's not a question in relation to confidence, it's more a question of saying, here's the cash number, it'll follow through from that.,2,1\n",

      "Should we assume that you've put in the 460 million for that give or take.,1,1\n",
      "And I guess allied to that, can you help us understand what you think the return on capital in the Openreach access division is at the moment against your load costs because it's pretty hard to work out in your regulatory financials?,3,2\n",

      "What I'd like to understand a bit better is the economic case of going the whole hog kind of beyond G.fast, et cetera, and upgrading to fiber-to-the-premise.,2,1\n",
      "What are the incremental revenues you can drive from FTTP as opposed to G.fast or, to put it another way, what are the applications that require FTTP?,1,1\n",
      "Thanks.,2,1\n",
      "A: We've always believed it is going to be a mixed technology solution that is the right solution for the UK.,1,1\n",
      "FTTC and upgrades to FTTC will be, I think, the majority of that.,1,1\n",
      "But what we've learnt with new techniques and new approaches over the last few months is that we can deliver FTTP at a much more cost-effective price point than we had a few years ago.,1,1\n",
      "So, I'm not going to steal Clive's story, because he spends a bit of time talking about this later, but there is a role for it to play.,1,3\n",
      "In the business markets, for example, in high streets, which have been some of the notspots that we've got at this point, and business parks.,1,1\n",
      "And in terms of where it sits in the portfolio, somewhere between the business connectivity provided by Ethernet and FTTC, there exists a point, I think in the business market, for an FTTP product.,1,1\n",
      "I think one of the other usage cases is housing developments.,1,1\n",
      "If we're in at the right point, it is just as easy and just as cost effective to put a fiber line in there as a copper line.,1,1\n",
      "And there's no question about it.,1,1\n",
      "We've got about 250,000 fiber lines today.,1,1\n",

      "We see content as a differentiator, not a stand-alone business per se.,1,1\n",
      "But we see its impact in terms of reducing line loss, ensuring that we continue to build our broadband and indeed a fiber customer base, has direct revenues both in the consumer market, where you can take the channel on satellite if you don't want to take our fiber and, indeed, you pay 5 a month if you don't want to be a BT TV customer.,1,3\n",

      "And interestingly, Sky said in their own results last week that they felt that using Openreach was probably the right way forward for them and that ducts and poles access was not going to be a priority.,2,1\n",

      "It is a weaker set of KPIs in the Consumer business, not completely unexpected given that we put forward a price change within the quarter and that was, I think, exploited by one or two of the other players in the market, not unexpectedly.,1,2\n",
      "I think we're also seeing that we are reaching a point where we are getting to saturation of the broadband market.,1,1\n",
      "It can't continue to grow forever.,1,1\n",
      "It is effectively defined by the number of premises across the UK, so we're not chasing broadband market share.,1,1\n",
      "I think we've made it clear that we see the priority to increase our share of wallet in RGUs per customer, which continued to grow.,1,1\n",
      "And I'm certainly confident that that strategy is working and the performance in Q4 was really down to pricing changes in the market.,2,1\n",
      "But, John, do you want to add some of your own perspective?,1,1\n",
      "A: Sure.,1,1\n",
      "Just to give a few thoughts on these points, Gavin, if I may.,1,1\n",
      "So, firstly, on the broadband performance, I think I've been very consistent in saying a number of times that the goal is not to chase customer net adds.,1,2\n",
      "Given that most people that want broadband in the UK currently have it, I think that's more and more the right strategy to focus on selling more to our existing customers.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the impact of the wider economy, it was a strong performance for the Consumer business in terms of the sales of SIMs and handsets to our customers.,1,1\n",
      "So, there's no sign that demand is softening overall.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of the pricing change specifically, the pricing change was generally, quite regardless of the timeframe that you look at, pretty much a positive for our business in terms of the profit growth it's given us, and there were some particular positives in terms of the proportion of customers that chose to re-contract with us too.,3,2\n",
      "That number actually increased.,1,1\n",
      "At the same time, there was an increase in churn as well.,1,1\n",
      "That's completely true.,3,1\n",
      "And there was a difference in this price change versus previous ones in that there were particular offers that customers could choose to buy into to re-contract.,1,1\n",
      "But there was no across-the-board change or improvement in the service standards or speeds for our customers.,2,1\n",
      "So there were some lessons to be taken from this change, but the strategy fundamentally works.,1,1\n",
      "And I think the potential to grow the Consumer business still very much stands in the future.,1,1\n"

      "And I guess separately related to that, you made a big point about the economics of G.fast, lower cost, get the speeds you need.,1,1\n",
      "Why a sudden change of wanting to ramp up to a much greater speed threshold if the trials are showing that G.fast is working so well?,3,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "A: I'll probably say a couple of words.,1,1\n",
      "I'll ask Simon to talk as well and maybe Clive given this is an Openreach plan, I think you might want to comment to that.,1,1\n",
      "Look, we've always said we are technology-agnostic and the market should be technology-agnostic, do not see the announcement today from Openreach as a move away from G.fast.,1,1\n",
      "We're confident that the existing plan is a strong one.,2,1\n",
      "We're beginning to roll it out.,1,1\n",
      "We've passed over 500,000 premises already, and you'll see that ramp up next year.,1,1\n",
      "And we're on track to deliver against the 10 million on G.fast and 2 million extra on FTTP by 2020.,1,1\n",
      "So there's no change there.,1,1\n",
      "That said, a couple of things around FTTP are worth noting.,1,1\n",
      "One is, as we are rolling out more of it, we're learning that we can do it at a lower unit cost.,1,1\n",
      "So the sorts of numbers that we were operating under even a year ago have come down dramatically, which means it is a more attractive proposition in more places across the UK and we continue to learn as we go through it.,2,1\n",
      "Then secondly, through the whole DCR process, one of the criticisms that was labeled at us was that we weren't consulting the market and getting a sense of whether there was demand for FTTP.,1,2\n",
      "So we wanted to use the new governance structure that has been set up around Openreach to really test the market, consult the market, allow Clive to talk to all his CPs including the downstream parts of BT in a confidential way so that he can assess whether there's a demand and whether or not we can underpin a business case.,1,1\n",
      "And that will be, I think, good for the market.,3,1\n",
      "But it will also be good for BT because ultimately, it means if there is a business case, we will have the demand underpinned.,3,1\n",
      "The demand will be there as opposed to us effectively having to invest ahead of the curve, not knowing whether or not people would buy it.,1,1\n",
      "Do you want to talk about the WLA as it stands at the moment and whether or not it really promotes investment?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah, I'll make a couple of short comments, but then I'll turn to Clive.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, I think as I mentioned in my remarks, as it stands, the WLA has significant adverse implications on returns, as it stands.,1,2\n",
      "The firstly, clearly, a significant reduction in the 40 megabits per second price impacts the prospective overall return on the investment we've already made and it calls into question what is meant by a fair bet, a fair bet in which one takes potentially the downside, but then has the equity return capped, doesn't strike us as a fair bet.,2,1\n",
      "So those are two issues, more specifically then to prospective investment in fibre-to-the-prem.,1,1\n",
      "Clearly, if you've lowered the cost of higher speed VDSL, for those premises, particularly if they're looking at a copper switch versus VDSL, that crushes the economics of that particular part of either case.,1,1\n",
      "So as I mentioned, we're hopeful that through the WLA consultation, these aspects will be properly discussed and understood to create a context in which we, the leading infrastructure player in the UK, can invest for the good of all our stakeholders.,3,1\n",
      "Clive, anything to add?,1,1\n",
      "A: Thank you.,1,1\n",
      "Morris, I think we're still completely committed to a mixed technology future.,1,1\n",
      "So VDSL coverage will be extended over the next few years, particularly as we serve the government objectives around the USO.,1,1\n",
      "The G.fast early deployment has gone very well.,1,1\n",
      "So, we are achieving the speeds at the line lengths that we had anticipated through lab and early trials.,1,1\n",
      "So we're very pleased with progress so far.,4,1\n",
      "And you will see that footprint grow from about 100,000 homes passed at the end of last financial year to 500,000 in the summertime, which gives us the opportunity to test it much more extensively, but that's looking good right now.,3,1\n",

      "One is we delivered more FTTP last year than any prior year, and we've run a whole sequence of trials in different areas, so city centers, high streets, suburbia and rural areas.,1,1\n",
      "So we are building much more competence at delivering FTTP and achieving much better cost points than we'd thought were possible historically.,2,1\n",
      "Also, once FTTP service is in and running for a customer, we're seeing materially lower fault rates, and that's very important in terms of ongoing cost of ownership.,1,2\n",
      "So it's not just about achieving lower build costs, it's about achieving lower cost of ownership ongoing.,1,1\n",
      "And actually, the service to customers is then able to support much higher bandwidths, and it's much more straightforward to guarantee bandwidth throughout the day.,2,1\n",
      "So, it's less susceptible to time of day variance.,1,2\n",
      "So, we're liking FTTP evermore.,3,1\n",
      "That's why we're consulting with our customers, the CPs, to understand their view on demand, their view on what will drive demand to move to those higher bandwidth products.,1,1\n",

      "And can you get them into the tent in a way that maybe DT has in Germany around the contingent plans, in a way that you haven't been able to previously under the new governance structure, notwithstanding the WLA negotiations that I'm sure you're going to be having for the next couple of months.,1,1\n",

      "And we're going to do that hand-in-glove with the CPs because ultimately they're the ones who have to compete and beat the alt-nets in the marketplace.,1,1\n",

      "But we recognize the market is changing.,1,1\n",

      "We're well-positioned to do that because the network itself remains very important to it, the global part of the network.,1,1\n",
      "But I think as part of it - as a consequence of that, the domestic networks that we have around the world, particularly in Europe, become less important to us.,1,1\n",
      "We don't rely on them as much to deliver competitive advantage.,1,1\n",
      "And so, you'll see us de-prioritize those over time.,1,1\n",
      "In terms of immediate actions, we are simplifying the operating model.,1,1\n",
      "We're restructuring the business.,1,1\n",
      "Within the 300 million is the Global Services component of that.,1,1\n",
      "So we're not giving you a breakout of how the 4,000 roles will be freed up, but there's a significant chunk of Global Services in that.,1,1\n",
      "And then over time, in terms of disposals, let me be very clear, we look at all parts of our business on a regular basis to understand whether or not the assets are better held by us or ultimately by other people.,2,1\n",
      "But in the meantime, the priority is self-help, restructuring the business, improving the overall margins.,2,1\n",
      "And I think over time, you'll see it being the overall CapEx mix becoming lighter.,1,1\n",
      "But you'll see that in terms of the way the margins move going forward.,1,1\n",
      "We do believe there is the scope to significantly enhance the returns we get out of Global Services and that was a point I really wanted to underscore within my presentation.,1,1\n",

      "And also the scale of the amount of amount of revenue, we still have on contracts, they're either migrating to the competition or ending a bit disaggregated into the market.,1,1\n",
      "But outside of what's happening on those specific contracts, we're actually still seeing quite strong demand for our services in the public sector.,1,1\n",
      "And particularly, as we've brought EE under mobile capability into Business and Public Sector over the last few years, we've seen very, very strong demand and we are growing share and growing our base quite aggressively.,1,3\n",
      "So, as businesses move to the cloud and they digitize, we think we're very well-positioned to win business and win business at good margins, because most of our customers are buying a number of services together and that creates the opportunity for us to grow our RGUs and to manage our margins within that context.,3,1\n",
      "And that's actually what we're doing now.,1,1\n",
      "And as we've dealt with these public sector contracts ending and exiting, we've also invested in our distribution under service.,1,1\n",
      "And we've seen quite a significant uplift in our pipeline over the last 12 months.,1,1\n",
      "So, our confidence about being able to manage our revenue profile and our EBITDA profile over the coming years has improved, I think, over the last six months.,2,1\n",

      "A: And I think - if I expand that, just to cover GS as well, I think what is true in both Public Sector and Global Services is - we're not going to chase deals at any sort of price.,2,2\n",
      "I mean, we turned or stepped back from a couple of major deals, Public Sector deals in the UK because we felt that the margins were unsustainable.,1,1\n",
      "And so we're not chasing revenue at low margin, and I think that's the watchword within the new Global Services model as well.,1,2\n",
      "The mix will change over time, but we're absolutely focused on returns and free cash flow.,1,1\n",
      "And that's - and those are going to be the metrics which really define its success over time.,3,1\n",

      "So I don't think that they have caused us to have the most problems this quarter.,1,2\n",
      "The spike in churn that we have preceded the price rise, quite independent of any pressure from Virgin.,1,2\n",
      "So, I think that's the first point.,1,1\n",
      "Looking to the future, I think that we're pretty well placed in terms of the offering that we have, in terms of firstly TV because the offering that we have is a skinnier bundle of TV.,3,1\n",
      "The market for full-fat kind of big basic TV is small and shrinking at the moment, first of all.,2,2\n",
      "Secondly, the advantage that we have in terms of quad-play and the mobile economics that we have in particular.,1,1\n",
      "And then thirdly, G.fast for the future gives us huge potential.,1,1\n",
      "And I think the Ofcom report on broadband speeds showed some of Virgin's vulnerabilities this quarter which was quite interesting.,2,3\n",
      "So this, it's a 12-montly report that Ofcom do.,1,1\n",
      "They look at a number of metrics such as performance on download speeds and performance on video streaming.,1,1\n",
      "And whilst the headline speeds for Virgin sound very attractive, the way cable networks are built is they contend locally.,3,2\n",
      "And what you saw for Virgin is a huge delta between the headline speeds and the performance at peak time.,1,1\n",
      "And the reason for the presentation that we gave this morning kind of referenced the Ofcom study because there's a big issue of trust in this category basically that consumers expect to get the promises that they're made through advertising.,2,1\n",
      "And I think Virgin have a vulnerability there and through G.fast and the technologies that we have including fibre-to-the-premise, there's very much an opportunity to compete with them aggressively.,1,3\n",
      "A: Keep it short though, Clive.,1,1\n",
      "A: Will do.,1,1\n",
      "Three quick things in response then.,1,1\n",
      "One is there's a materially lower churn rate from our infrastructure, where the customer is on VDSL rather than ADSL2+.,1,1\n",
      "So, our policy is to get the customers on to VDSL.,1,1\n",
      "We have a huge platform.,1,1\n",
      "There's 26.5 million customers it can reach, so that's strategy one.,1,1\n",
      "Strategy two is get the G.fast footprint built out and then compete with much higher speeds.,1,1\n",
      "And the third point is there's very clear evidence that as we raise service levels, so customers who do not have faults, do not have faults that are outstanding for a long time, if you can improve your service, you reduce your churn.,3,2\n",
      "And we've spent a lot of time focusing on that over the last 12 months and you'll see us continue to do that.,1,1\n",
      "We will raise service levels.,1,1\n",
      "A: Thanks Clive.,1,1\n",
      "Simon.,1,1\n",
      "Q: Yeah, if I could, it's Simon Weeden from Citi.,1,1\n",
      "Thank you.,2,1\n",
      "Wondered if I could draw you out a bit more on CapEx and the sort of shape of what we might be looking at.,1,1\n",

      "A: But I think the first one is, we've made it pretty clear that our guidance for this year is based on our existing investment plans, which is completion of the VDSL program and getting customers on to that and then leading into the 10 million G.fast and 2 million FTTP program.,3,1\n",
      "That's what we'd announced.,1,1\n",
      "I'm not going to give guidance beyond, but what we have said, I think pretty consistently, is that as we complete the ESN program, which is quite a significant capital commitment for us and as some of our integration programs went down, that creates some capacity within our investment in order to start ramping up the - and of course, we're also bringing down the VDSL.,3,1\n",

      "The reason is there's no such thing as a point number.,1,1\n",
      "It's incredibly determined by the particular topology that you're investing into and it's also determined by the way in which the rollout is executed.,1,2\n",
      "And of course, that's something that we'll get into in the consultation.,1,1\n",

      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",

      "So firstly, we expect Ofcom to live up to the commitments that we made and they made when we rolled out a 2.5 billion fibre investment in 2009 based on a 13-year return and 13 years, the way I add it up, comes to 2022.,1,1\n",
      "Secondly, actually at the end of the day, the only way we managed to get a deal with Ofcom was the mutual realization the right thing for the country was to do this deal and create the infrastructure we need to be competitive.,1,1\n",
      "We will deploy those same arguments on WLA.,1,2\n",

      "On the pension, I just have a very quick question for Simon.,1,1\n",
      "The net pension deficit was a upside surprise quarter-on-quarter.,1,2\n",
      "Could you talk a little bit about how that came about, because I don't think that gilt rates have moved a great deal.,3,1\n",
      "So I think it was over 9 billion net of tax in Q3, 7.6 billion now.,1,2\n",
      "So what are the moving parts there?,1,1\n",
      "A: Yeah.,1,1\n",
      "I mean, shortly, I mean we've had good performance on the assets.,3,1\n",
      "In addition to that, we have refined and brought into line our treatment of inflation and the way we basically match the maturity, the duration of the inflation curve to the liabilities.,1,3\n",
      "So, that's also had an impact, but it's essentially a combination of those factors.,1,1\n",

      "As you know, we've taken BT content and given that to our customer base, hundreds of thousands of customers enjoying that service and they're happy and starting to generate revenue for us there.,3,1\n",
      "And obviously, on the mobile side, we're working very closely together to ensure that we're smart about targeting the right customers, i.e., customers of our competitors, not each others' brands to drive incremental net adds.,2,1\n",
      "And you can see from the group's mobile performance, another strong quarter in terms of commercial momentum.,1,1\n",
      "And from EE's perspective on pricing, we continue to show revenue growth.,1,1\n",
      "For the first time in our history, we hit that last year, and obviously - last quarter, rather.,1,1\n",
      "And this quarter, continued momentum there as well.,1,1\n",
      "So the strategy looks like it's working well in a very competitive market.,2,1\n",
